    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Virginia Woolf:**<br>\n",
    "Virginia Woolf is one of English Literature's most famed novelists, a canonical figure of Ango-American modernism. Considered one of the most important 20th-century writers, Woolf pioneered, among other things, her own style of free indirect discourse and stream-of-conscious narratives. Many of her works, including the notable Mrs. Dalloway and To The Lighthouse, are considered iconic modernist texts that truly defined the genre and the era.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Novels like these placed Woolf at the center of the modernist reinvention of literature, specifically novels, to focus on the subjective, rather than objective, human experience. However, critical essays like A Room of One's Own and Three Guineas positioned her as a respected and perceptive social critic who wrote in support of feminism and anti-colonial pacifism. While Woolf's works span various genres, covering biographies and political critiques, her writing style is unique in her lyrical novels. Her novels and short stories often take topics previously considered mundane and commonplace and create intricate and engaging discourse within each character. The intensity of Woolf's writing style and her ability to evoke emotion out of almost every and any situation create worlds abundant with emotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This Project:**<br>\n",
    "Through text-mining and data analysis, this project hopes to paint an alternate picture of the emotions that illuminate and illustrate the worlds Woolf creates, to quantitatively visualize the fluctuation of emotions within her characters, her worlds, and her ideas. We will rediscover Woolf’s most influential novels, essays, and stories through the quantitative analysis of sentiment throughout her texts. By restructuring the character, arguments, opinions, and consciousnesses that Woolf created, we can reinterpret the emotion weaved throughout her texts and, through new lenses, revisit the worlds that Woolf created."

    "**Research Questions:**<br>\n",
    "This research study analyzes the sentences which construct Woolf's novels to investigate further the role of positive and negative emotion in her work. By interpreting the mood of her texts' sentences and words, we might visualize how emotion changes throughout each text. How do our quantitative analysis of sentiment compare and contrast to our qualitative analysis? What differences in understanding arise when replacing a human interpreter, reading sentence by sentence, with a computer interpreter that parses through sentence by sentence? How might these differences cause us to think more critically about Woolf's texts?"

    "**Method Overview:**<br>\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a text analysis method that detects polarity within a text, whether a whole document, paragraph, sentence, or clause. With sentiment analysis using the VADER method (discussed below), we hope to measure the speaker's attitude, sentiments, and emotions based on the computational treatment of subjectivity in each of Woolf's texts."

    "**Data Description**<br>\n",
    "The data used for this sentiment analysis was web-scraped from online e-books provided by Project Gutenberg Australia, which provides free e-books by authors who died before 1955. Using BeautifulSoup to process each web page, I extracted the text from each site, often correlated with Woolf's respective work. After extracting the text, I processed it into sentences through a text-mining function written below. Upon separating the text into sentences (which proved more complicated than anticipated!), I created a dataframe for each text, each row an individual sentence. Then, with a dataframe made for each of Woolf's text, I was ready to perform some exciting analyses!"

       "'\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself. For Lucy had her work cut out for her. The doors would be taken\\r\\noff their hinges; Rumpelmayer\\'s men were coming. And then, thought\\r\\nClarissa Dalloway, what a morning--fresh as if issued to children on\\r\\na beach. What a lark! What a plunge! For so it had always seemed to her,\\r\\nwhen, with a little squeak of the hinges, which she could hear now,\\r\\nshe had burst open the French windows and plunged at Bourton into the\\r\\nopen air. How fresh, how calm, stiller than this of course, the air\\r\\nwas in the early morning; like the flap of a wave; the kiss of a\\r\\nwave; chill and sharp and yet (for a girl of eighteen as she then\\r\\nwas) solemn, feeling as she did, standing there at the open window,\\r\\nthat something awful was about to happen; looking at the flowers, at\\r\\nthe trees with the smoke winding off them and the rooks rising,\\r\\nfalling; standing and looking until Peter Walsh said, \"Musing among\\r\\nthe vegetables?\"--was that it?--\"I prefer men to cauliflowers\"--was\\r\\nthat it? He must have said it at breakfast one morning when she had\\r\\ngone out on to the terrace--Peter Walsh. He would be back from India\\r\\none of these days, June or July, she forgot which, for his letters\\r\\nwere awfully dull; it was his sayings one remembered; his eyes, his\\r\\npocket-knife, his smile, his grumpiness and, when millions of things\\r\\nhad utterly vanished--how strange it was!--a few sayings like this\\r\\nabout cabbages. She stiffened a little on the kerb, waiting for Durtnall\\'s van to\\r\\npass. A charming woman, Scrope Purvis thought her (knowing her as one\\r\\ndoes know people who live next door to one in Westminster); a touch\\r\\nof the bird about her, of the jay, blue-green, light, vivacious,\\r\\nthough she was over fifty, and grown very white since her illness.\\r\\nThere she perched, never seeing him, waiting to cross, very\\r\\nupright. For having lived in Westminster--how many years now? over\\r\\ntwenty,--one feels even in the midst of the traffic, or waking at\\r\\nnight, Clarissa was positive, a particular hush, or solemnity; an\\r\\nindescribable pause; a suspense (but that might be her heart,\\r\\naffected, they said, by influenza) before Big Ben strikes. There! Out\\r\\nit boomed. First a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable. The\\r\\nleaden circles dissolved in the air. Such fools we are, she thought,\\r\\ncrossing Victoria Street. For Heaven only knows why one loves it so,\\r\\nhow one sees it so, making it up, building it round one, tumbling it,\\r\\ncreating it every moment afresh; but the veriest frumps, the most\\r\\ndejected of miseries sitting on doorsteps (drink their downfall) do\\r\\nthe same; can\\'t be dealt with, she felt positive, by Acts of\\r\\nParliament for that very reason: they love life. In people\\'s eyes, in\\r\\nthe swing, tramp, and trudge; in the bellow and the uproar; the\\r\\ncarriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling and\\r\\nswinging; brass bands; barrel organs; in the triumph and the jingle\\r\\nand the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she\\r\\nloved; life; London; this moment of June. For it was the middle of June. The War was over, except for some\\r\\none like Mrs. Foxcroft at the Embassy last night eating her heart out\\r\\nbecause that nice boy was killed and now the old Manor House must go\\r\\nto a cousin; or Lady Bexborough who opened a bazaar, they said, with\\r\\nthe telegram in her hand, John, her favourite, killed; but it was\\r\\nover; thank Heaven--over. It was June. The King and Queen were at the\\r\\nPalace. And everywhere, though it was still so early, there was a\\r\\nbeating, a stirring of galloping ponies, tapping of cricket bats;\\r\\nLords, Ascot, Ranelagh and all the rest of it; wrapped in the soft\\r\\nmesh of the grey-blue morning air, which, as the day wore on, would\\r\\nunwind them, and set down on their lawns and pitches the bouncing\\r\\nponies, whose forefeet just struck the ground and up they sprung, the\\r\\nwhirling young men, and laughing girls in their transparent muslins\\r\\nwho, even now, after dancing all night, were taking their absurd\\r\\nwoolly dogs for a run; and even now, at this hour, discreet old\\r\\ndowagers were shooting out in their motor cars on errands of mystery;\\r\\nand the shopkeepers were fidgeting in their windows with their paste\\r\\nand diamonds, their lovely old sea-green brooches in\\r\\neighteenth-century settings to tempt Americans (but one must\\r\\neconomise, not buy things rashly for Elizabeth), and she, too, loving\\r\\nit as she did with an absurd and faithful passion, being part of it,\\r\\nsince her people were courtiers once in the time of the Georges, she,\\r\\ntoo, was going that very night to kindle and illuminate; to give her\\r\\nparty. But how strange, on entering the Park, the silence; the mist;\\r\\nthe hum; the slow-swimming happy ducks; the pouched birds waddling;\\r\\nand who should be coming along with his back against the Government\\r\\nbuildings, most appropriately, carrying a despatch box stamped with\\r\\nthe Royal Arms, who but Hugh Whitbread; her old friend Hugh--the\\r\\nadmirable Hugh! \"Good-morning to you, Clarissa!\" said Hugh, rather extravagantly,\\r\\nfor they had known each other as children. \"Where are you off\\r\\nto?\" \"I love walking in London,\" said Mrs. Dalloway. \"Really it\\'s\\r\\nbetter than walking in the country.\" They had just come up--unfortunately--to see doctors. Other people\\r\\ncame to see pictures; go to the opera; take their daughters out; the\\r\\nWhitbreads came \"to see doctors.\" Times without number Clarissa had\\r\\nvisited Evelyn Whitbread in a nursing home. Was Evelyn ill again?\\r\\nEvelyn was a good deal out of sorts, said Hugh, intimating by a kind\\r\\nof pout or swell of his very well-covered, manly, extremely handsome,\\r\\nperfectly upholstered body (he was almost too well dressed always,\\r\\nbut presumably had to be, with his little job at Court) that his wife\\r\\nhad some internal ailment, nothing serious, which, as an old friend,\\r\\nClarissa Dalloway would quite understand without requiring him to\\r\\nspecify. Ah yes, she did of course; what a nuisance; and felt very\\r\\nsisterly and oddly conscious at the same time of her hat. Not the\\r\\nright hat for the early morning, was that it? For Hugh always made\\r\\nher feel, as he bustled on, raising his hat rather extravagantly and\\r\\nassuring her that she might be a girl of eighteen, and of course he\\r\\nwas coming to her party to-night, Evelyn absolutely insisted, only a\\r\\nlittle late he might be after the party at the Palace to which he had\\r\\nto take one of Jim\\'s boys,--she always felt a little skimpy beside\\r\\nHugh; schoolgirlish; but attached to him, partly from having known\\r\\nhim always, but she did think him a good sort in his own way, though\\r\\nRichard was nearly driven mad by him, and as for Peter Walsh, he had\\r\\nnever to this day forgiven her for liking him. She could remember scene after scene at Bourton--Peter furious;\\r\\nHugh not, of course, his match in any way, but still not a positive\\r\\nimbecile as Peter made out; not a mere barber\\'s block. When his old\\r\\nmother wanted him to give up shooting or to take her to Bath he did\\r\\nit, without a word; he was really unselfish, and as for saying, as\\r\\nPeter did, that he had no heart, no brain, nothing but the manners\\r\\nand breeding of an English gentleman, that was only her dear Peter at\\r\\nhis worst; and he could be intolerable; he could be impossible; but\\r\\nadorable to walk with on a morning like this. (June had drawn out every leaf on the trees. The mothers of\\r\\nPimlico gave suck to their young. Messages were passing from the\\r\\nFleet to the Admiralty. Arlington Street and Piccadilly seemed to\\r\\nchafe the very air in the Park and lift its leaves hotly,\\r\\nbrilliantly, on waves of that divine vitality which Clarissa loved.\\r\\nTo dance, to ride, she had adored all that.) For they might be parted for hundreds of years, she and Peter; she\\r\\nnever wrote a letter and his were dry sticks; but suddenly it would\\r\\ncome over her, If he were with me now what would he say?--some days,\\r\\nsome sights bringing him back to her calmly, without the old\\r\\nbitterness; which perhaps was the reward of having cared for people;\\r\\nthey came back in the middle of St. James\\'s Park on a fine\\r\\nmorning--indeed they did. But Peter--however beautiful the day might\\r\\nbe, and the trees and the grass, and the little girl in pink--Peter\\r\\nnever saw a thing of all that. He would put on his spectacles, if she\\r\\ntold him to; he would look. It was the state of the world that\\r\\ninterested him; Wagner, Pope\\'s poetry, people\\'s characters eternally,\\r\\nand the defects of her own soul. How he scolded her! How they argued!\\r\\nShe would marry a Prime Minister and stand at the top of a staircase;\\r\\nthe perfect hostess he called her (she had cried over it in her\\r\\nbedroom), she had the makings of the perfect hostess, he said. So she would still find herself arguing in St. James\\'s Park, still\\r\\nmaking out that she had been right--and she had too--not to marry\\r\\nhim. For in marriage a little licence, a little independence there\\r\\nmust be between people living together day in day out in the same\\r\\nhouse; which Richard gave her, and she him. (Where was he this\\r\\nmorning for instance? Some committee, she never asked what.) But with\\r\\nPeter everything had to be shared; everything gone into. And it was\\r\\nintolerable, and when it came to that scene in the little garden by\\r\\nthe fountain, she had to break with him or they would have been\\r\\ndestroyed, both of them ruined, she was convinced; though she had\\r\\nborne about with her for years like an arrow sticking in her heart\\r\\nthe grief, the anguish; and then the horror of the moment when some\\r\\none told her at a concert that he had married a woman met on the boat\\r\\ngoing to India! Never should she forget all that! Cold, heartless, a\\r\\nprude, he called her. Never could she understand how he cared. But\\r\\nthose Indian women did presumably--silly, pretty, flimsy nincompoops.\\r\\nAnd she wasted her pity. For he was quite happy, he assured\\r\\nher--perfectly happy, though he had never done a thing that they\\r\\ntalked of; his whole life had been a failure. It made her angry\\r\\nstill. She had reached the Park gates. She stood for a moment, looking at\\r\\nthe omnibuses in Piccadilly. She would not say of any one in the world now that they were this\\r\\nor were that. She felt very young; at the same time unspeakably aged.\\r\\nShe sliced like a knife through everything; at the same time was\\r\\noutside, looking on. She had a perpetual sense, as she watched the\\r\\ntaxi cabs, of being out, out, far out to sea and alone; she always\\r\\nhad the feeling that it was very, very dangerous to live even one\\r\\nday. Not that she thought herself clever, or much out of the\\r\\nordinary. How she had got through life on the few twigs of knowledge\\r\\nFräulein Daniels gave them she could not think. She knew\\r\\nnothing; no language, no history; she scarcely read a book now,\\r\\nexcept memoirs in bed; and yet to her it was absolutely absorbing;\\r\\nall this; the cabs passing; and she would not say of Peter, she would\\r\\nnot say of herself, I am this, I am that. Her only gift was knowing people almost by instinct, she thought,\\r\\nwalking on. If you put her in a room with some one, up went her back\\r\\nlike a cat\\'s; or she purred. Devonshire House, Bath House, the house\\r\\nwith the china cockatoo, she had seen them all lit up once; and\\r\\nremembered Sylvia, Fred, Sally Seton--such hosts of people; and\\r\\ndancing all night; and the waggons plodding past to market; and\\r\\ndriving home across the Park. She remembered once throwing a shilling\\r\\ninto the Serpentine. But every one remembered; what she loved was\\r\\nthis, here, now, in front of her; the fat lady in the cab. Did it\\r\\nmatter then, she asked herself, walking towards Bond Street, did it\\r\\nmatter that she must inevitably cease completely; all this must go on\\r\\nwithout her; did she resent it; or did it not become consoling to\\r\\nbelieve that death ended absolutely? but that somehow in the streets\\r\\nof London, on the ebb and flow of things, here, there, she survived,\\r\\nPeter survived, lived in each other, she being part, she was\\r\\npositive, of the trees at home; of the house there, ugly, rambling\\r\\nall to bits and pieces as it was; part of people she had never met;\\r\\nbeing laid out like a mist between the people she knew best, who\\r\\nlifted her on their branches as she had seen the trees lift the mist,\\r\\nbut it spread ever so far, her life, herself. But what was she\\r\\ndreaming as she looked into Hatchards\\' shop window? What was she\\r\\ntrying to recover? What image of white dawn in the country, as she\\r\\nread in the book spread open: \\xa0 Fear no more the heat o\\' the sun \\r\\n Nor the furious winter\\'s rages. \\xa0 This late age of the world\\'s experience had bred in them all, all\\r\\nmen and women, a well of tears. Tears and sorrows; courage and\\r\\nendurance; a perfectly upright and stoical bearing. Think, for\\r\\nexample, of the woman she admired most, Lady Bexborough, opening the\\r\\nbazaar. There were Jorrocks\\'   there were\\r\\n  and Mrs. Asquith\\'s   and   all spread open. Ever so many books there\\r\\nwere; but none that seemed exactly right to take to Evelyn Whitbread\\r\\nin her nursing home. Nothing that would serve to amuse her and make\\r\\nthat indescribably dried-up little woman look, as Clarissa came in,\\r\\njust for a moment cordial; before they settled down for the usual\\r\\ninterminable talk of women\\'s ailments. How much she wanted it--that\\r\\npeople should look pleased as she came in, Clarissa thought and\\r\\nturned and walked back towards Bond Street, annoyed, because it was\\r\\nsilly to have other reasons for doing things. Much rather would she\\r\\nhave been one of those people like Richard who did things for\\r\\nthemselves, whereas, she thought, waiting to cross, half the time she\\r\\ndid things not simply, not for themselves; but to make people think\\r\\nthis or that; perfect idiocy she knew (and now the policeman held up\\r\\nhis hand) for no one was ever for a second taken in. Oh if she could\\r\\nhave had her life over again! she thought, stepping on to the\\r\\npavement, could have looked even differently! She would have been, in the first place, dark like Lady\\r\\nBexborough, with a skin of crumpled leather and beautiful eyes. She\\r\\nwould have been, like Lady Bexborough, slow and stately; rather\\r\\nlarge; interested in politics like a man; with a country house; very\\r\\ndignified, very sincere. Instead of which she had a narrow pea-stick\\r\\nfigure; a ridiculous little face, beaked like a bird\\'s. That she held\\r\\nherself well was true; and had nice hands and feet; and dressed well,\\r\\nconsidering that she spent little. But often now this body she wore\\r\\n(she stopped to look at a Dutch picture), this body, with all its\\r\\ncapacities, seemed nothing--nothing at all. She had the oddest sense\\r\\nof being herself invisible; unseen; unknown; there being no more\\r\\nmarrying, no more having of children now, but only this astonishing\\r\\nand rather solemn progress with the rest of them, up Bond Street,\\r\\nthis being Mrs. Dalloway; not even Clarissa any more; this being Mrs.\\r\\nRichard Dalloway. Bond Street fascinated her; Bond Street early in the morning in\\r\\nthe season; its flags flying; its shops; no splash; no glitter; one\\r\\nroll of tweed in the shop where her father had bought his suits for\\r\\nfifty years; a few pearls; salmon on an iceblock. \"That is all,\" she said, looking at the fishmonger\\'s. \"That is\\r\\nall,\" she repeated, pausing for a moment at the window of a glove\\r\\nshop where, before the War, you could buy almost perfect gloves. And\\r\\nher old Uncle William used to say a lady is known by her shoes and\\r\\nher gloves. He had turned on his bed one morning in the middle of the\\r\\nWar. He had said, \"I have had enough.\" Gloves and shoes; she had a\\r\\npassion for gloves; but her own daughter, her Elizabeth, cared not a\\r\\nstraw for either of them. Not a straw, she thought, going on up Bond Street to a shop where\\r\\nthey kept flowers for her when she gave a party. Elizabeth really\\r\\ncared for her dog most of all. The whole house this morning smelt of\\r\\ntar. Still, better poor Grizzle than Miss Kilman; better distemper\\r\\nand tar and all the rest of it than sitting mewed in a stuffy bedroom\\r\\nwith a prayer book! Better anything, she was inclined to say. But it\\r\\nmight be only a phase, as Richard said, such as all girls go through.\\r\\nIt might be falling in love. But why with Miss Kilman? who had been\\r\\nbadly treated of course; one must make allowances for that, and\\r\\nRichard said she was very able, had a really historical mind. Anyhow\\r\\nthey were inseparable, and Elizabeth, her own daughter, went to\\r\\nCommunion; and how she dressed, how she treated people who came to\\r\\nlunch she did not care a bit, it being her experience that the\\r\\nreligious ecstasy made people callous (so did causes); dulled their\\r\\nfeelings, for Miss Kilman would do anything for the Russians, starved\\r\\nherself for the Austrians, but in private inflicted positive torture,\\r\\nso insensitive was she, dressed in a green mackintosh coat. Year in\\r\\nyear out she wore that coat; she perspired; she was never in the room\\r\\nfive minutes without making you feel her superiority, your\\r\\ninferiority; how poor she was; how rich you were; how she lived in a\\r\\nslum without a cushion or a bed or a rug or whatever it might be, all\\r\\nher soul rusted with that grievance sticking in it, her dismissal\\r\\nfrom school during the War--poor embittered unfortunate creature! For\\r\\nit was not her one hated but the idea of her, which undoubtedly had\\r\\ngathered in to itself a great deal that was not Miss Kilman; had\\r\\nbecome one of those spectres with which one battles in the night; one\\r\\nof those spectres who stand astride us and suck up half our\\r\\nlife-blood, dominators and tyrants; for no doubt with another throw\\r\\nof the dice, had the black been uppermost and not the white, she\\r\\nwould have loved Miss Kilman! But not in this world. No. It rasped her, though, to have stirring about in her this brutal\\r\\nmonster! to hear twigs cracking and feel hooves planted down in the\\r\\ndepths of that leaf-encumbered forest, the soul; never to be content\\r\\nquite, or quite secure, for at any moment the brute would be\\r\\nstirring, this hatred, which, especially since her illness, had power\\r\\nto make her feel scraped, hurt in her spine; gave her physical pain,\\r\\nand made all pleasure in beauty, in friendship, in being well, in\\r\\nbeing loved and making her home delightful rock, quiver, and bend as\\r\\nif indeed there were a monster grubbing at the roots, as if the whole\\r\\npanoply of content were nothing but self love! this hatred! Nonsense, nonsense! she cried to herself, pushing through the\\r\\nswing doors of Mulberry\\'s the florists. She advanced, light, tall, very upright, to be greeted at once by\\r\\nbutton-faced Miss Pym, whose hands were always bright red, as if they\\r\\nhad been stood in cold water with the flowers. There were flowers: delphiniums, sweet peas, bunches of lilac; and\\r\\ncarnations, masses of carnations. There were roses; there were\\r\\nirises. Ah yes--so she breathed in the earthy garden sweet smell as\\r\\nshe stood talking to Miss Pym who owed her help, and thought her\\r\\nkind, for kind she had been years ago; very kind, but she looked\\r\\nolder, this year, turning her head from side to side among the irises\\r\\nand roses and nodding tufts of lilac with her eyes half closed,\\r\\nsnuffing in, after the street uproar, the delicious scent, the\\r\\nexquisite coolness. And then, opening her eyes, how fresh like\\r\\nfrilled linen clean from a laundry laid in wicker trays the roses\\r\\nlooked; and dark and prim the red carnations, holding their heads up;\\r\\nand all the sweet peas spreading in their bowls, tinged violet, snow\\r\\nwhite, pale--as if it were the evening and girls in muslin frocks\\r\\ncame out to pick sweet peas and roses after the superb summer\\'s day,\\r\\nwith its almost blue-black sky, its delphiniums, its carnations, its\\r\\narum lilies was over; and it was the moment between six and seven\\r\\nwhen every flower--roses, carnations, irises, lilac--glows; white,\\r\\nviolet, red, deep orange; every flower seems to burn by itself,\\r\\nsoftly, purely in the misty beds; and how she loved the grey-white\\r\\nmoths spinning in and out, over the cherry pie, over the evening\\r\\nprimroses! And as she began to go with Miss Pym from jar to jar, choosing,\\r\\nnonsense, nonsense, she said to herself, more and more gently, as if\\r\\nthis beauty, this scent, this colour, and Miss Pym liking her,\\r\\ntrusting her, were a wave which she let flow over her and surmount\\r\\nthat hatred, that monster, surmount it all; and it lifted her up and\\r\\nup when--oh! a pistol shot in the street outside! \"Dear, those motor cars,\" said Miss Pym, going to the window to\\r\\nlook, and coming back and smiling apologetically with her hands full\\r\\nof sweet peas, as if those motor cars, those tyres of motor cars,\\r\\nwere all   fault. \\xa0 \\xa0 The violent explosion which made Mrs. Dalloway jump and Miss Pym\\r\\ngo to the window and apologise came from a motor car which had drawn\\r\\nto the side of the pavement precisely opposite Mulberry\\'s shop\\r\\nwindow. Passers-by who, of course, stopped and stared, had just time\\r\\nto see a face of the very greatest importance against the dove-grey\\r\\nupholstery, before a male hand drew the blind and there was nothing\\r\\nto be seen except a square of dove grey. Yet rumours were at once in circulation from the middle of Bond\\r\\nStreet to Oxford Street on one side, to Atkinson\\'s scent shop on the\\r\\nother, passing invisibly, inaudibly, like a cloud, swift, veil-like\\r\\nupon hills, falling indeed with something of a cloud\\'s sudden\\r\\nsobriety and stillness upon faces which a second before had been\\r\\nutterly disorderly. But now mystery had brushed them with her wing;\\r\\nthey had heard the voice of authority; the spirit of religion was\\r\\nabroad with her eyes bandaged tight and her lips gaping wide. But\\r\\nnobody knew whose face had been seen. Was it the Prince of Wales\\'s,\\r\\nthe Queen\\'s, the Prime Minister\\'s? Whose face was it? Nobody\\r\\nknew. Edgar J. Watkiss, with his roll of lead piping round his arm, said\\r\\naudibly, humorously of course: \"The Proime Minister\\'s kyar.\" Septimus Warren Smith, who found himself unable to pass, heard\\r\\nhim. Septimus Warren Smith, aged about thirty, pale-faced, beak-nosed,\\r\\nwearing brown shoes and a shabby overcoat, with hazel eyes which had\\r\\nthat look of apprehension in them which makes complete strangers\\r\\napprehensive too. The world has raised its whip; where will it\\r\\ndescend? Everything had come to a standstill. The throb of the motor\\r\\nengines sounded like a pulse irregularly drumming through an entire\\r\\nbody. The sun became extraordinarily hot because the motor car had\\r\\nstopped outside Mulberry\\'s shop window; old ladies on the tops of\\r\\nomnibuses spread their black parasols; here a green, here a red\\r\\nparasol opened with a little pop. Mrs. Dalloway, coming to the window\\r\\nwith her arms full of sweet peas, looked out with her little pink\\r\\nface pursed in enquiry. Every one looked at the motor car. Septimus\\r\\nlooked. Boys on bicycles sprang off. Traffic accumulated. And there\\r\\nthe motor car stood, with drawn blinds, and upon them a curious\\r\\npattern like a tree, Septimus thought, and this gradual drawing\\r\\ntogether of everything to one centre before his eyes, as if some\\r\\nhorror had come almost to the surface and was about to burst into\\r\\nflames, terrified him. The world wavered and quivered and threatened\\r\\nto burst into flames. It is I who am blocking the way, he thought.\\r\\nWas he not being looked at and pointed at; was he not weighted there,\\r\\nrooted to the pavement, for a purpose? But for what purpose? \"Let us go on, Septimus,\" said his wife, a little woman, with\\r\\nlarge eyes in a sallow pointed face; an Italian girl. But Lucrezia herself could not help looking at the motor car and\\r\\nthe tree pattern on the blinds. Was it the Queen in there--the Queen\\r\\ngoing shopping? The chauffeur, who had been opening something, turning something,\\r\\nshutting something, got on to the box. \"Come on,\" said Lucrezia. But her husband, for they had been married four, five years now,\\r\\njumped, started, and said, \"All right!\" angrily, as if she had\\r\\ninterrupted him. People must notice; people must see. People, she thought, looking\\r\\nat the crowd staring at the motor car; the English people, with their\\r\\nchildren and their horses and their clothes, which she admired in a\\r\\nway; but they were \"people\" now, because Septimus had said, \"I will\\r\\nkill myself\"; an awful thing to say. Suppose they had heard him? She\\r\\nlooked at the crowd. Help, help! she wanted to cry out to butchers\\'\\r\\nboys and women. Help! Only last autumn she and Septimus had stood on\\r\\nthe Embankment wrapped in the same cloak and, Septimus reading a\\r\\npaper instead of talking, she had snatched it from him and laughed in\\r\\nthe old man\\'s face who saw them! But failure one conceals. She must\\r\\ntake him away into some park. \"Now we will cross,\" she said. She had a right to his arm, though it was without feeling. He\\r\\nwould give her, who was so simple, so impulsive, only twenty-four,\\r\\nwithout friends in England, who had left Italy for his sake, a piece\\r\\nof bone. The motor car with its blinds drawn and an air of inscrutable\\r\\nreserve proceeded towards Piccadilly, still gazed at, still ruffling\\r\\nthe faces on both sides of the street with the same dark breath of\\r\\nveneration whether for Queen, Prince, or Prime Minister nobody knew.\\r\\nThe face itself had been seen only once by three people for a few\\r\\nseconds. Even the sex was now in dispute. But there could be no doubt\\r\\nthat greatness was seated within; greatness was passing, hidden, down\\r\\nBond Street, removed only by a hand\\'s-breadth from ordinary people\\r\\nwho might now, for the first and last time, be within speaking\\r\\ndistance of the majesty of England, of the enduring symbol of the\\r\\nstate which will be known to curious antiquaries, sifting the ruins\\r\\nof time, when London is a grass-grown path and all those hurrying\\r\\nalong the pavement this Wednesday morning are but bones with a few\\r\\nwedding rings mixed up in their dust and the gold stoppings of\\r\\ninnumerable decayed teeth. The face in the motor car will then be\\r\\nknown. It is probably the Queen, thought Mrs. Dalloway, coming out of\\r\\nMulberry\\'s with her flowers; the Queen. And for a second she wore a\\r\\nlook of extreme dignity standing by the flower shop in the sunlight\\r\\nwhile the car passed at a foot\\'s pace, with its blinds drawn. The\\r\\nQueen going to some hospital; the Queen opening some bazaar, thought\\r\\nClarissa. The crush was terrific for the time of day. Lords, Ascot,\\r\\nHurlingham, what was it? she wondered, for the street was blocked.\\r\\nThe British middle classes sitting sideways on the tops of omnibuses\\r\\nwith parcels and umbrellas, yes, even furs on a day like this, were,\\r\\nshe thought, more ridiculous, more unlike anything there has ever\\r\\nbeen than one could conceive; and the Queen herself held up; the\\r\\nQueen herself unable to pass. Clarissa was suspended on one side of\\r\\nBrook Street; Sir John Buckhurst, the old Judge on the other, with\\r\\nthe car between them (Sir John had laid down the law for years and\\r\\nliked a well-dressed woman) when the chauffeur, leaning ever so\\r\\nslightly, said or showed something to the policeman, who saluted and\\r\\nraised his arm and jerked his head and moved the omnibus to the side\\r\\nand the car passed through. Slowly and very silently it took its\\r\\nway. Clarissa guessed; Clarissa knew of course; she had seen something\\r\\nwhite, magical, circular, in the footman\\'s hand, a disc inscribed\\r\\nwith a name,--the Queen\\'s, the Prince of Wales\\'s, the Prime\\r\\nMinister\\'s?--which, by force of its own lustre, burnt its way through\\r\\n(Clarissa saw the car diminishing, disappearing), to blaze among\\r\\ncandelabras, glittering stars, breasts stiff with oak leaves, Hugh\\r\\nWhitbread and all his colleagues, the gentlemen of England, that\\r\\nnight in Buckingham Palace. And Clarissa, too, gave a party. She\\r\\nstiffened a little; so she would stand at the top of her stairs. The car had gone, but it had left a slight ripple which flowed\\r\\nthrough glove shops and hat shops and tailors\\' shops on both sides of\\r\\nBond Street. For thirty seconds all heads were inclined the same\\r\\nway--to the window. Choosing a pair of gloves--should they be to the\\r\\nelbow or above it, lemon or pale grey?--ladies stopped; when the\\r\\nsentence was finished something had happened. Something so trifling\\r\\nin single instances that no mathematical instrument, though capable\\r\\nof transmitting shocks in China, could register the vibration; yet in\\r\\nits fulness rather formidable and in its common appeal emotional; for\\r\\nin all the hat shops and tailors\\' shops strangers looked at each\\r\\nother and thought of the dead; of the flag; of Empire. In a public\\r\\nhouse in a back street a Colonial insulted the House of Windsor which\\r\\nled to words, broken beer glasses, and a general shindy, which echoed\\r\\nstrangely across the way in the ears of girls buying white underlinen\\r\\nthreaded with pure white ribbon for their weddings. For the surface\\r\\nagitation of the passing car as it sunk grazed something very\\r\\nprofound. Gliding across Piccadilly, the car turned down St. James\\'s Street.\\r\\nTall men, men of robust physique, well-dressed men with their\\r\\ntail-coats and their white slips and their hair raked back who, for\\r\\nreasons difficult to discriminate, were standing in the bow window of\\r\\nBrooks\\'s with their hands behind the tails of their coats, looking\\r\\nout, perceived instinctively that greatness was passing, and the pale\\r\\nlight of the immortal presence fell upon them as it had fallen upon\\r\\nClarissa Dalloway. At once they stood even straighter, and removed\\r\\ntheir hands, and seemed ready to attend their Sovereign, if need be,\\r\\nto the cannon\\'s mouth, as their ancestors had done before them. The\\r\\nwhite busts and the little tables in the background covered with\\r\\ncopies of the   and syphons of soda water seemed to\\r\\napprove; seemed to indicate the flowing corn and the manor houses of\\r\\nEngland; and to return the frail hum of the motor wheels as the walls\\r\\nof a whispering gallery return a single voice expanded and made\\r\\nsonorous by the might of a whole cathedral. Shawled Moll Pratt with\\r\\nher flowers on the pavement wished the dear boy well (it was the\\r\\nPrince of Wales for certain) and would have tossed the price of a pot\\r\\nof beer--a bunch of roses--into St. James\\'s Street out of sheer\\r\\nlight-heartedness and contempt of poverty had she not seen the\\r\\nconstable\\'s eye upon her, discouraging an old Irishwoman\\'s loyalty.\\r\\nThe sentries at St. James\\'s saluted; Queen Alexandra\\'s policeman\\r\\napproved. A small crowd meanwhile had gathered at the gates of Buckingham\\r\\nPalace. Listlessly, yet confidently, poor people all of them, they\\r\\nwaited; looked at the Palace itself with the flag flying; at\\r\\nVictoria, billowing on her mound, admired her shelves of running\\r\\nwater, her geraniums; singled out from the motor cars in the Mall\\r\\nfirst this one, then that; bestowed emotion, vainly, upon commoners\\r\\nout for a drive; recalled their tribute to keep it unspent while this\\r\\ncar passed and that; and all the time let rumour accumulate in their\\r\\nveins and thrill the nerves in their thighs at the thought of Royalty\\r\\nlooking at them; the Queen bowing; the Prince saluting; at the\\r\\nthought of the heavenly life divinely bestowed upon Kings; of the\\r\\nequerries and deep curtsies; of the Queen\\'s old doll\\'s house; of\\r\\nPrincess Mary married to an Englishman, and the Prince--ah! the\\r\\nPrince! who took wonderfully, they said, after old King Edward, but\\r\\nwas ever so much slimmer. The Prince lived at St. James\\'s; but he\\r\\nmight come along in the morning to visit his mother. So Sarah Bletchley said with her baby in her arms, tipping her\\r\\nfoot up and down as though she were by her own fender in Pimlico, but\\r\\nkeeping her eyes on the Mall, while Emily Coates ranged over the\\r\\nPalace windows and thought of the housemaids, the innumerable\\r\\nhousemaids, the bedrooms, the innumerable bedrooms. Joined by an\\r\\nelderly gentleman with an Aberdeen terrier, by men without\\r\\noccupation, the crowd increased. Little Mr. Bowley, who had rooms in\\r\\nthe Albany and was sealed with wax over the deeper sources of life\\r\\nbut could be unsealed suddenly, inappropriately, sentimentally, by\\r\\nthis sort of thing--poor women waiting to see the Queen go past--poor\\r\\nwomen, nice little children, orphans, widows, the\\r\\nWar--tut-tut--actually had tears in his eyes. A breeze flaunting ever\\r\\nso warmly down the Mall through the thin trees, past the bronze\\r\\nheroes, lifted some flag flying in the British breast of Mr. Bowley\\r\\nand he raised his hat as the car turned into the Mall and held it\\r\\nhigh as the car approached; and let the poor mothers of Pimlico press\\r\\nclose to him, and stood very upright. The car came on. Suddenly Mrs. Coates looked up into the sky. The sound of an\\r\\naeroplane bored ominously into the ears of the crowd. There it was\\r\\ncoming over the trees, letting out white smoke from behind, which\\r\\ncurled and twisted, actually writing something! making letters in the\\r\\nsky! Every one looked up. Dropping dead down the aeroplane soared straight up, curved in a\\r\\nloop, raced, sank, rose, and whatever it did, wherever it went, out\\r\\nfluttered behind it a thick ruffled bar of white smoke which curled\\r\\nand wreathed upon the sky in letters. But what letters? A C was it?\\r\\nan E, then an L? Only for a moment did they lie still; then they\\r\\nmoved and melted and were rubbed out up in the sky, and the aeroplane\\r\\nshot further away and again, in a fresh space of sky, began writing a\\r\\nK, an E, a Y perhaps? \"Glaxo,\" said Mrs. Coates in a strained, awe-stricken voice,\\r\\ngazing straight up, and her baby, lying stiff and white in her arms,\\r\\ngazed straight up. \"Kreemo,\" murmured Mrs. Bletchley, like a sleep-walker. With his\\r\\nhat held out perfectly still in his hand, Mr. Bowley gazed straight\\r\\nup. All down the Mall people were standing and looking up into the\\r\\nsky. As they looked the whole world became perfectly silent, and a\\r\\nflight of gulls crossed the sky, first one gull leading, then\\r\\nanother, and in this extraordinary silence and peace, in this pallor,\\r\\nin this purity, bells struck eleven times, the sound fading up there\\r\\namong the gulls. The aeroplane turned and raced and swooped exactly where it liked,\\r\\nswiftly, freely, like a skater-- \"That\\'s an E,\" said Mrs. Bletchley--or a dancer-- \"It\\'s toffee,\" murmured Mr. Bowley--(and the car went in at the\\r\\ngates and nobody looked at it), and shutting off the smoke, away and\\r\\naway it rushed, and the smoke faded and assembled itself round the\\r\\nbroad white shapes of the clouds. It had gone; it was behind the clouds. There was no sound. The\\r\\nclouds to which the letters E, G, or L had attached themselves moved\\r\\nfreely, as if destined to cross from West to East on a mission of the\\r\\ngreatest importance which would never be revealed, and yet certainly\\r\\nso it was--a mission of the greatest importance. Then suddenly, as a\\r\\ntrain comes out of a tunnel, the aeroplane rushed out of the clouds\\r\\nagain, the sound boring into the ears of all people in the Mall, in\\r\\nthe Green Park, in Piccadilly, in Regent Street, in Regent\\'s Park,\\r\\nand the bar of smoke curved behind and it dropped down, and it soared\\r\\nup and wrote one letter after another--but what word was it\\r\\nwriting? Lucrezia Warren Smith, sitting by her husband\\'s side on a seat in\\r\\nRegent\\'s Park in the Broad Walk, looked up. \"Look, look, Septimus!\" she cried. For Dr. Holmes had told her to\\r\\nmake her husband (who had nothing whatever seriously the matter with\\r\\nhim but was a little out of sorts) take an interest in things outside\\r\\nhimself. So, thought Septimus, looking up, they are signalling to me. Not\\r\\nindeed in actual words; that is, he could not read the language yet;\\r\\nbut it was plain enough, this beauty, this exquisite beauty, and\\r\\ntears filled his eyes as he looked at the smoke words languishing and\\r\\nmelting in the sky and bestowing upon him in their inexhaustible\\r\\ncharity and laughing goodness one shape after another of unimaginable\\r\\nbeauty and signalling their intention to provide him, for nothing,\\r\\nfor ever, for looking merely, with beauty, more beauty! Tears ran\\r\\ndown his cheeks. It was toffee; they were advertising toffee, a nursemaid told\\r\\nRezia. Together they began to spell t . . . o . . . f . . . \"K . . . R . . .\" said the nursemaid, and Septimus heard her say\\r\\n\"Kay Arr\" close to his ear, deeply, softly, like a mellow organ, but\\r\\nwith a roughness in her voice like a grasshopper\\'s, which rasped his\\r\\nspine deliciously and sent running up into his brain waves of sound\\r\\nwhich, concussing, broke. A marvellous discovery indeed--that the\\r\\nhuman voice in certain atmospheric conditions (for one must be\\r\\nscientific, above all scientific) can quicken trees into life!\\r\\nHappily Rezia put her hand with a tremendous weight on his knee so\\r\\nthat he was weighted down, transfixed, or the excitement of the elm\\r\\ntrees rising and falling, rising and falling with all their leaves\\r\\nalight and the colour thinning and thickening from blue to the green\\r\\nof a hollow wave, like plumes on horses\\' heads, feathers on ladies\\',\\r\\nso proudly they rose and fell, so superbly, would have sent him mad.\\r\\nBut he would not go mad. He would shut his eyes; he would see no\\r\\nmore. But they beckoned; leaves were alive; trees were alive. And the\\r\\nleaves being connected by millions of fibres with his own body, there\\r\\non the seat, fanned it up and down; when the branch stretched he,\\r\\ntoo, made that statement. The sparrows fluttering, rising, and\\r\\nfalling in jagged fountains were part of the pattern; the white and\\r\\nblue, barred with black branches. Sounds made harmonies with\\r\\npremeditation; the spaces between them were as significant as the\\r\\nsounds. A child cried. Rightly far away a horn sounded. All taken\\r\\ntogether meant the birth of a new religion-- \"Septimus!\" said Rezia. He started violently. People must\\r\\nnotice. \"I am going to walk to the fountain and back,\" she said. For she could stand it no longer. Dr. Holmes might say there was\\r\\nnothing the matter. Far rather would she that he were dead! She could\\r\\nnot sit beside him when he stared so and did not see her and made\\r\\neverything terrible; sky and tree, children playing, dragging carts,\\r\\nblowing whistles, falling down; all were terrible. And he would not\\r\\nkill himself; and she could tell no one. \"Septimus has been working\\r\\ntoo hard\"--that was all she could say to her own mother. To love\\r\\nmakes one solitary, she thought. She could tell nobody, not even\\r\\nSeptimus now, and looking back, she saw him sitting in his shabby\\r\\novercoat alone, on the seat, hunched up, staring. And it was cowardly\\r\\nfor a man to say he would kill himself, but Septimus had fought; he\\r\\nwas brave; he was not Septimus now. She put on her lace collar. She\\r\\nput on her new hat and he never noticed; and he was happy without\\r\\nher. Nothing could make her happy without him! Nothing! He was\\r\\nselfish. So men are. For he was not ill. Dr. Holmes said there was\\r\\nnothing the matter with him. She spread her hand before her. Look!\\r\\nHer wedding ring slipped--she had grown so thin. It was she who\\r\\nsuffered--but she had nobody to tell. Far was Italy and the white houses and the room where her sisters\\r\\nsat making hats, and the streets crowded every evening with people\\r\\nwalking, laughing out loud, not half alive like people here, huddled\\r\\nup in Bath chairs, looking at a few ugly flowers stuck in pots! \"For you should see the Milan gardens,\" she said aloud. But to\\r\\nwhom? There was nobody. Her words faded. So a rocket fades. Its sparks,\\r\\nhaving grazed their way into the night, surrender to it, dark\\r\\ndescends, pours over the outlines of houses and towers; bleak\\r\\nhillsides soften and fall in. But though they are gone, the night is\\r\\nfull of them; robbed of colour, blank of windows, they exist more\\r\\nponderously, give out what the frank daylight fails to transmit--the\\r\\ntrouble and suspense of things conglomerated there in the darkness;\\r\\nhuddled together in the darkness; reft of the relief which dawn\\r\\nbrings when, washing the walls white and grey, spotting each\\r\\nwindow-pane, lifting the mist from the fields, showing the red-brown\\r\\ncows peacefully grazing, all is once more decked out to the eye;\\r\\nexists again. I am alone; I am alone! she cried, by the fountain in\\r\\nRegent\\'s Park (staring at the Indian and his cross), as perhaps at\\r\\nmidnight, when all boundaries are lost, the country reverts to its\\r\\nancient shape, as the Romans saw it, lying cloudy, when they landed,\\r\\nand the hills had no names and rivers wound they knew not where--such\\r\\nwas her darkness; when suddenly, as if a shelf were shot forth and\\r\\nshe stood on it, she said how she was his wife, married years ago in\\r\\nMilan, his wife, and would never, never tell that he was mad!\\r\\nTurning, the shelf fell; down, down she dropped. For he was gone, she\\r\\nthought--gone, as he threatened, to kill himself--to throw himself\\r\\nunder a cart! But no; there he was; still sitting alone on the seat,\\r\\nin his shabby overcoat, his legs crossed, staring, talking aloud. Men must not cut down trees. There is a God. (He noted such\\r\\nrevelations on the backs of envelopes.) Change the world. No one\\r\\nkills from hatred. Make it known (he wrote it down). He waited. He\\r\\nlistened. A sparrow perched on the railing opposite chirped Septimus,\\r\\nSeptimus, four or five times over and went on, drawing its notes out,\\r\\nto sing freshly and piercingly in Greek words how there is no crime\\r\\nand, joined by another sparrow, they sang in voices prolonged and\\r\\npiercing in Greek words, from trees in the meadow of life beyond a\\r\\nriver where the dead walk, how there is no death. There was his hand; there the dead. White things were assembling\\r\\nbehind the railings opposite. But he dared not look. Evans was behind\\r\\nthe railings! \"What are you saying?\" said Rezia suddenly, sitting down by\\r\\nhim. Interrupted again! She was always interrupting. Away from people--they must get away from people, he said (jumping\\r\\nup), right away over there, where there were chairs beneath a tree\\r\\nand the long slope of the park dipped like a length of green stuff\\r\\nwith a ceiling cloth of blue and pink smoke high above, and there was\\r\\na rampart of far irregular houses hazed in smoke, the traffic hummed\\r\\nin a circle, and on the right, dun-coloured animals stretched long\\r\\nnecks over the Zoo palings, barking, howling. There they sat down\\r\\nunder a tree. \"Look,\" she implored him, pointing at a little troop of boys\\r\\ncarrying cricket stumps, and one shuffled, spun round on his heel and\\r\\nshuffled, as if he were acting a clown at the music hall. \"Look,\" she implored him, for Dr. Holmes had told her to make him\\r\\nnotice real things, go to a music hall, play cricket--that was the\\r\\nvery game, Dr. Holmes said, a nice out-of-door game, the very game\\r\\nfor her husband. \"Look,\" she repeated. Look the unseen bade him, the voice which now communicated with\\r\\nhim who was the greatest of mankind, Septimus, lately taken from life\\r\\nto death, the Lord who had come to renew society, who lay like a\\r\\ncoverlet, a snow blanket smitten only by the sun, for ever unwasted,\\r\\nsuffering for ever, the scapegoat, the eternal sufferer, but he did\\r\\nnot want it, he moaned, putting from him with a wave of his hand that\\r\\neternal suffering, that eternal loneliness. \"Look,\" she repeated, for he must not talk aloud to himself out of\\r\\ndoors. \"Oh look,\" she implored him. But what was there to look at? A few\\r\\nsheep. That was all. The way to Regent\\'s Park Tube station--could they tell her the way\\r\\nto Regent\\'s Park Tube station--Maisie Johnson wanted to know. She was\\r\\nonly up from Edinburgh two days ago. \"Not this way--over there!\" Rezia exclaimed, waving her aside,\\r\\nlest she should see Septimus. Both seemed queer, Maisie Johnson thought. Everything seemed very\\r\\nqueer. In London for the first time, come to take up a post at her\\r\\nuncle\\'s in Leadenhall Street, and now walking through Regent\\'s Park\\r\\nin the morning, this couple on the chairs gave her quite a turn; the\\r\\nyoung woman seeming foreign, the man looking queer; so that should\\r\\nshe be very old she would still remember and make it jangle again\\r\\namong her memories how she had walked through Regent\\'s Park on a fine\\r\\nsummer\\'s morning fifty years ago. For she was only nineteen and had\\r\\ngot her way at last, to come to London; and now how queer it was,\\r\\nthis couple she had asked the way of, and the girl started and jerked\\r\\nher hand, and the man--he seemed awfully odd; quarrelling, perhaps;\\r\\nparting for ever, perhaps; something was up, she knew; and now all\\r\\nthese people (for she returned to the Broad Walk), the stone basins,\\r\\nthe prim flowers, the old men and women, invalids most of them in\\r\\nBath chairs--all seemed, after Edinburgh, so queer. And Maisie\\r\\nJohnson, as she joined that gently trudging, vaguely gazing,\\r\\nbreeze-kissed company--squirrels perching and preening, sparrow\\r\\nfountains fluttering for crumbs, dogs busy with the railings, busy\\r\\nwith each other, while the soft warm air washed over them and lent to\\r\\nthe fixed unsurprised gaze with which they received life something\\r\\nwhimsical and mollified--Maisie Johnson positively felt she must cry\\r\\nOh! (for that young man on the seat had given her quite a turn.\\r\\nSomething was up, she knew.) Horror! horror! she wanted to cry. (She had left her people; they\\r\\nhad warned her what would happen.) Why hadn\\'t she stayed at home? she cried, twisting the knob of the\\r\\niron railing. That girl, thought Mrs. Dempster (who saved crusts for the\\r\\nsquirrels and often ate her lunch in Regent\\'s Park), don\\'t know a\\r\\nthing yet; and really it seemed to her better to be a little stout, a\\r\\nlittle slack, a little moderate in one\\'s expectations. Percy drank.\\r\\nWell, better to have a son, thought Mrs. Dempster. She had had a hard\\r\\ntime of it, and couldn\\'t help smiling at a girl like that. You\\'ll get\\r\\nmarried, for you\\'re pretty enough, thought Mrs. Dempster. Get\\r\\nmarried, she thought, and then you\\'ll know. Oh, the cooks, and so on.\\r\\nEvery man has his ways. But whether I\\'d have chosen quite like that\\r\\nif I could have known, thought Mrs. Dempster, and could not help\\r\\nwishing to whisper a word to Maisie Johnson; to feel on the creased\\r\\npouch of her worn old face the kiss of pity. For it\\'s been a hard\\r\\nlife, thought Mrs. Dempster. What hadn\\'t she given to it? Roses;\\r\\nfigure; her feet too. (She drew the knobbed lumps beneath her\\r\\nskirt.) Roses, she thought sardonically. All trash, m\\'dear. For really,\\r\\nwhat with eating, drinking, and mating, the bad days and good, life\\r\\nhad been no mere matter of roses, and what was more, let me tell you,\\r\\nCarrie Dempster had no wish to change her lot with any woman\\'s in\\r\\nKentish Town! But, she implored, pity. Pity, for the loss of roses.\\r\\nPity she asked of Maisie Johnson, standing by the hyacinth beds. Ah, but that aeroplane! Hadn\\'t Mrs. Dempster always longed to see\\r\\nforeign parts? She had a nephew, a missionary. It soared and shot.\\r\\nShe always went on the sea at Margate, not out o\\' sight of land, but\\r\\nshe had no patience with women who were afraid of water. It swept and\\r\\nfell. Her stomach was in her mouth. Up again. There\\'s a fine young\\r\\nfeller aboard of it, Mrs. Dempster wagered, and away and away it\\r\\nwent, fast and fading, away and away the aeroplane shot; soaring over\\r\\nGreenwich and all the masts; over the little island of grey churches,\\r\\nSt. Paul\\'s and the rest till, on either side of London, fields spread\\r\\nout and dark brown woods where adventurous thrushes hopping boldly,\\r\\nglancing quickly, snatched the snail and tapped him on a stone, once,\\r\\ntwice, thrice. Away and away the aeroplane shot, till it was nothing but a bright\\r\\nspark; an aspiration; a concentration; a symbol (so it seemed to Mr.\\r\\nBentley, vigorously rolling his strip of turf at Greenwich) of man\\'s\\r\\nsoul; of his determination, thought Mr. Bentley, sweeping round the\\r\\ncedar tree, to get outside his body, beyond his house, by means of\\r\\nthought, Einstein, speculation, mathematics, the Mendelian\\r\\ntheory--away the aeroplane shot. Then, while a seedy-looking nondescript man carrying a leather bag\\r\\nstood on the steps of St. Paul\\'s Cathedral, and hesitated, for within\\r\\nwas what balm, how great a welcome, how many tombs with banners\\r\\nwaving over them, tokens of victories not over armies, but over, he\\r\\nthought, that plaguy spirit of truth seeking which leaves me at\\r\\npresent without a situation, and more than that, the cathedral offers\\r\\ncompany, he thought, invites you to membership of a society; great\\r\\nmen belong to it; martyrs have died for it; why not enter in, he\\r\\nthought, put this leather bag stuffed with pamphlets before an altar,\\r\\na cross, the symbol of something which has soared beyond seeking and\\r\\nquesting and knocking of words together and has become all spirit,\\r\\ndisembodied, ghostly--why not enter in? he thought and while he\\r\\nhesitated out flew the aeroplane over Ludgate Circus. It was strange; it was still. Not a sound was to be heard above\\r\\nthe traffic. Unguided it seemed; sped of its own free will. And now,\\r\\ncurving up and up, straight up, like something mounting in ecstasy,\\r\\nin pure delight, out from behind poured white smoke looping, writing\\r\\na T, an O, an F. \\xa0 \\xa0 \"What are they looking at?\" said Clarissa Dalloway to the maid who\\r\\nopened her door. The hall of the house was cool as a vault. Mrs. Dalloway raised\\r\\nher hand to her eyes, and, as the maid shut the door to, and she\\r\\nheard the swish of Lucy\\'s skirts, she felt like a nun who has left\\r\\nthe world and feels fold round her the familiar veils and the\\r\\nresponse to old devotions. The cook whistled in the kitchen. She\\r\\nheard the click of the typewriter. It was her life, and, bending her\\r\\nhead over the hall table, she bowed beneath the influence, felt\\r\\nblessed and purified, saying to herself, as she took the pad with the\\r\\ntelephone message on it, how moments like this are buds on the tree\\r\\nof life, flowers of darkness they are, she thought (as if some lovely\\r\\nrose had blossomed for her eyes only); not for a moment did she\\r\\nbelieve in God; but all the more, she thought, taking up the pad,\\r\\nmust one repay in daily life to servants, yes, to dogs and canaries,\\r\\nabove all to Richard her husband, who was the foundation of it--of\\r\\nthe gay sounds, of the green lights, of the cook even whistling, for\\r\\nMrs. Walker was Irish and whistled all day long--one must pay back\\r\\nfrom this secret deposit of exquisite moments, she thought, lifting\\r\\nthe pad, while Lucy stood by her, trying to explain how \"Mr. Dalloway, ma\\'am\"-- Clarissa read on the telephone pad, \"Lady Bruton wishes to know if\\r\\nMr. Dalloway will lunch with her to-day.\" \"Mr. Dalloway, ma\\'am, told me to tell you he would be lunching\\r\\nout.\" \"Dear!\" said Clarissa, and Lucy shared as she meant her to her\\r\\ndisappointment (but not the pang); felt the concord between them;\\r\\ntook the hint; thought how the gentry love; gilded her own future\\r\\nwith calm; and, taking Mrs. Dalloway\\'s parasol, handled it like a\\r\\nsacred weapon which a Goddess, having acquitted herself honourably in\\r\\nthe field of battle, sheds, and placed it in the umbrella stand. \"Fear no more,\" said Clarissa. Fear no more the heat o\\' the sun;\\r\\nfor the shock of Lady Bruton asking Richard to lunch without her made\\r\\nthe moment in which she had stood shiver, as a plant on the river-bed\\r\\nfeels the shock of a passing oar and shivers: so she rocked: so she\\r\\nshivered. Millicent Bruton, whose lunch parties were said to be\\r\\nextraordinarily amusing, had not asked her. No vulgar jealousy could\\r\\nseparate her from Richard. But she feared time itself, and read on\\r\\nLady Bruton\\'s face, as if it had been a dial cut in impassive stone,\\r\\nthe dwindling of life; how year by year her share was sliced; how\\r\\nlittle the margin that remained was capable any longer of stretching,\\r\\nof absorbing, as in the youthful years, the colours, salts, tones of\\r\\nexistence, so that she filled the room she entered, and felt often as\\r\\nshe stood hesitating one moment on the threshold of her drawing-room,\\r\\nan exquisite suspense, such as might stay a diver before plunging\\r\\nwhile the sea darkens and brightens beneath him, and the waves which\\r\\nthreaten to break, but only gently split their surface, roll and\\r\\nconceal and encrust as they just turn over the weeds with pearl. She put the pad on the hall table. She began to go slowly\\r\\nupstairs, with her hand on the bannisters, as if she had left a\\r\\nparty, where now this friend now that had flashed back her face, her\\r\\nvoice; had shut the door and gone out and stood alone, a single\\r\\nfigure against the appalling night, or rather, to be accurate,\\r\\nagainst the stare of this matter-of-fact June morning; soft with the\\r\\nglow of rose petals for some, she knew, and felt it, as she paused by\\r\\nthe open staircase window which let in blinds flapping, dogs barking,\\r\\nlet in, she thought, feeling herself suddenly shrivelled, aged,\\r\\nbreastless, the grinding, blowing, flowering of the day, out of\\r\\ndoors, out of the window, out of her body and brain which now failed,\\r\\nsince Lady Bruton, whose lunch parties were said to be\\r\\nextraordinarily amusing, had not asked her. Like a nun withdrawing, or a child exploring a tower, she went\\r\\nupstairs, paused at the window, came to the bathroom. There was the\\r\\ngreen linoleum and a tap dripping. There was an emptiness about the\\r\\nheart of life; an attic room. Women must put off their rich apparel.\\r\\nAt midday they must disrobe. She pierced the pincushion and laid her\\r\\nfeathered yellow hat on the bed. The sheets were clean, tight\\r\\nstretched in a broad white band from side to side. Narrower and\\r\\nnarrower would her bed be. The candle was half burnt down and she had\\r\\nread deep in Baron Marbot\\'s   She had read late at\\r\\nnight of the retreat from Moscow. For the House sat so long that\\r\\nRichard insisted, after her illness, that she must sleep undisturbed.\\r\\nAnd really she preferred to read of the retreat from Moscow. He knew\\r\\nit. So the room was an attic; the bed narrow; and lying there\\r\\nreading, for she slept badly, she could not dispel a virginity\\r\\npreserved through childbirth which clung to her like a sheet. Lovely\\r\\nin girlhood, suddenly there came a moment--for example on the river\\r\\nbeneath the woods at Clieveden--when, through some contraction of\\r\\nthis cold spirit, she had failed him. And then at Constantinople, and\\r\\nagain and again. She could see what she lacked. It was not beauty; it\\r\\nwas not mind. It was something central which permeated; something\\r\\nwarm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and\\r\\nwoman, or of women together. For   she could dimly\\r\\nperceive. She resented it, had a scruple picked up Heaven knows\\r\\nwhere, or, as she felt, sent by Nature (who is invariably wise); yet\\r\\nshe could not resist sometimes yielding to the charm of a woman, not\\r\\na girl, of a woman confessing, as to her they often did, some scrape,\\r\\nsome folly. And whether it was pity, or their beauty, or that she was\\r\\nolder, or some accident--like a faint scent, or a violin next door\\r\\n(so strange is the power of sounds at certain moments), she did\\r\\nundoubtedly then feel what men felt. Only for a moment; but it was\\r\\nenough. It was a sudden revelation, a tinge like a blush which one\\r\\ntried to check and then, as it spread, one yielded to its expansion,\\r\\nand rushed to the farthest verge and there quivered and felt the\\r\\nworld come closer, swollen with some astonishing significance, some\\r\\npressure of rapture, which split its thin skin and gushed and poured\\r\\nwith an extraordinary alleviation over the cracks and sores! Then,\\r\\nfor that moment, she had seen an illumination; a match burning in a\\r\\ncrocus; an inner meaning almost expressed. But the close withdrew;\\r\\nthe hard softened. It was over--the moment. Against such moments\\r\\n(with women too) there contrasted (as she laid her hat down) the bed\\r\\nand Baron Marbot and the candle half-burnt. Lying awake, the floor\\r\\ncreaked; the lit house was suddenly darkened, and if she raised her\\r\\nhead she could just hear the click of the handle released as gently\\r\\nas possible by Richard, who slipped upstairs in his socks and then,\\r\\nas often as not, dropped his hot-water bottle and swore! How she\\r\\nlaughed! But this question of love (she thought, putting her coat away),\\r\\nthis falling in love with women. Take Sally Seton; her relation in\\r\\nthe old days with Sally Seton. Had not that, after all, been\\r\\nlove? She sat on the floor--that was her first impression of Sally--she\\r\\nsat on the floor with her arms round her knees, smoking a cigarette.\\r\\nWhere could it have been? The Mannings? The Kinloch-Jones\\'s? At some\\r\\nparty (where, she could not be certain), for she had a distinct\\r\\nrecollection of saying to the man she was with, \"Who is  \\r\\nAnd he had told her, and said that Sally\\'s parents did not get on\\r\\n(how that shocked her--that one\\'s parents should quarrel!). But all\\r\\nthat evening she could not take her eyes off Sally. It was an\\r\\nextraordinary beauty of the kind she most admired, dark, large-eyed,\\r\\nwith that quality which, since she hadn\\'t got it herself, she always\\r\\nenvied--a sort of abandonment, as if she could say anything, do\\r\\nanything; a quality much commoner in foreigners than in Englishwomen.\\r\\nSally always said she had French blood in her veins, an ancestor had\\r\\nbeen with Marie Antoinette, had his head cut off, left a ruby ring.\\r\\nPerhaps that summer she came to stay at Bourton, walking in quite\\r\\nunexpectedly without a penny in her pocket, one night after dinner,\\r\\nand upsetting poor Aunt Helena to such an extent that she never\\r\\nforgave her. There had been some quarrel at home. She literally\\r\\nhadn\\'t a penny that night when she came to them--had pawned a brooch\\r\\nto come down. She had rushed off in a passion. They sat up till all\\r\\nhours of the night talking. Sally it was who made her feel, for the\\r\\nfirst time, how sheltered the life at Bourton was. She knew nothing\\r\\nabout sex--nothing about social problems. She had once seen an old\\r\\nman who had dropped dead in a field--she had seen cows just after\\r\\ntheir calves were born. But Aunt Helena never liked discussion of\\r\\nanything (when Sally gave her William Morris, it had to be wrapped in\\r\\nbrown paper). There they sat, hour after hour, talking in her bedroom\\r\\nat the top of the house, talking about life, how they were to reform\\r\\nthe world. They meant to found a society to abolish private property,\\r\\nand actually had a letter written, though not sent out. The ideas\\r\\nwere Sally\\'s, of course--but very soon she was just as excited--read\\r\\nPlato in bed before breakfast; read Morris; read Shelley by the\\r\\nhour. Sally\\'s power was amazing, her gift, her personality. There was\\r\\nher way with flowers, for instance. At Bourton they always had stiff\\r\\nlittle vases all the way down the table. Sally went out, picked\\r\\nhollyhocks, dahlias--all sorts of flowers that had never been seen\\r\\ntogether--cut their heads off, and made them swim on the top of water\\r\\nin bowls. The effect was extraordinary--coming in to dinner in the\\r\\nsunset. (Of course Aunt Helena thought it wicked to treat flowers\\r\\nlike that.) Then she forgot her sponge, and ran along the passage\\r\\nnaked. That grim old housemaid, Ellen Atkins, went about\\r\\ngrumbling--\"Suppose any of the gentlemen had seen?\" Indeed she did\\r\\nshock people. She was untidy, Papa said. The strange thing, on looking back, was the purity, the integrity,\\r\\nof her feeling for Sally. It was not like one\\'s feeling for a man. It\\r\\nwas completely disinterested, and besides, it had a quality which\\r\\ncould only exist between women, between women just grown up. It was\\r\\nprotective, on her side; sprang from a sense of being in league\\r\\ntogether, a presentiment of something that was bound to part them\\r\\n(they spoke of marriage always as a catastrophe), which led to this\\r\\nchivalry, this protective feeling which was much more on her side\\r\\nthan Sally\\'s. For in those days she was completely reckless; did the\\r\\nmost idiotic things out of bravado; bicycled round the parapet on the\\r\\nterrace; smoked cigars. Absurd, she was--very absurd. But the charm\\r\\nwas overpowering, to her at least, so that she could remember\\r\\nstanding in her bedroom at the top of the house holding the hot-water\\r\\ncan in her hands and saying aloud, \"She is beneath this roof. . . .\\r\\nShe is beneath this roof!\" No, the words meant absolutely nothing to her now. She could not\\r\\neven get an echo of her old emotion. But she could remember going\\r\\ncold with excitement, and doing her hair in a kind of ecstasy (now\\r\\nthe old feeling began to come back to her, as she took out her\\r\\nhairpins, laid them on the dressing-table, began to do her hair),\\r\\nwith the rooks flaunting up and down in the pink evening light, and\\r\\ndressing, and going downstairs, and feeling as she crossed the hall\\r\\n\"if it were now to die \\'twere now to be most happy.\" That was her\\r\\nfeeling--Othello\\'s feeling, and she felt it, she was convinced, as\\r\\nstrongly as Shakespeare meant Othello to feel it, all because she was\\r\\ncoming down to dinner in a white frock to meet Sally Seton! She was wearing pink gauze--was that possible? She  \\r\\nanyhow, all light, glowing, like some bird or air ball that has flown\\r\\nin, attached itself for a moment to a bramble. But nothing is so\\r\\nstrange when one is in love (and what was this except being in love?)\\r\\nas the complete indifference of other people. Aunt Helena just\\r\\nwandered off after dinner; Papa read the paper. Peter Walsh might\\r\\nhave been there, and old Miss Cummings; Joseph Breitkopf certainly\\r\\nwas, for he came every summer, poor old man, for weeks and weeks, and\\r\\npretended to read German with her, but really played the piano and\\r\\nsang Brahms without any voice. All this was only a background for Sally. She stood by the\\r\\nfireplace talking, in that beautiful voice which made everything she\\r\\nsaid sound like a caress, to Papa, who had begun to be attracted\\r\\nrather against his will (he never got over lending her one of his\\r\\nbooks and finding it soaked on the terrace), when suddenly she said,\\r\\n\"What a shame to sit indoors!\" and they all went out on to the\\r\\nterrace and walked up and down. Peter Walsh and Joseph Breitkopf went\\r\\non about Wagner. She and Sally fell a little behind. Then came the\\r\\nmost exquisite moment of her whole life passing a stone urn with\\r\\nflowers in it. Sally stopped; picked a flower; kissed her on the\\r\\nlips. The whole world might have turned upside down! The others\\r\\ndisappeared; there she was alone with Sally. And she felt that she\\r\\nhad been given a present, wrapped up, and told just to keep it, not\\r\\nto look at it--a diamond, something infinitely precious, wrapped up,\\r\\nwhich, as they walked (up and down, up and down), she uncovered, or\\r\\nthe radiance burnt through, the revelation, the religious\\r\\nfeeling!--when old Joseph and Peter faced them: \"Star-gazing?\" said Peter. It was like running one\\'s face against a granite wall in the\\r\\ndarkness! It was shocking; it was horrible! Not for herself. She felt only how Sally was being mauled already,\\r\\nmaltreated; she felt his hostility; his jealousy; his determination\\r\\nto break into their companionship. All this she saw as one sees a\\r\\nlandscape in a flash of lightning--and Sally (never had she admired\\r\\nher so much!) gallantly taking her way unvanquished. She laughed. She\\r\\nmade old Joseph tell her the names of the stars, which he liked doing\\r\\nvery seriously. She stood there: she listened. She heard the names of\\r\\nthe stars. \"Oh this horror!\" she said to herself, as if she had known all\\r\\nalong that something would interrupt, would embitter her moment of\\r\\nhappiness. Yet, after all, how much she owed to him later. Always when she\\r\\nthought of him she thought of their quarrels for some reason--because\\r\\nshe wanted his good opinion so much, perhaps. She owed him words:\\r\\n\"sentimental,\" \"civilised\"; they started up every day of her life as\\r\\nif he guarded her. A book was sentimental; an attitude to life\\r\\nsentimental. \"Sentimental,\" perhaps she was to be thinking of the\\r\\npast. What would he think, she wondered, when he came back? That she had grown older? Would he say that, or would she see him\\r\\nthinking when he came back, that she had grown older? It was true.\\r\\nSince her illness she had turned almost white. Laying her brooch on the table, she had a sudden spasm, as if,\\r\\nwhile she mused, the icy claws had had the chance to fix in her. She\\r\\nwas not old yet. She had just broken into her fifty-second year.\\r\\nMonths and months of it were still untouched. June, July, August!\\r\\nEach still remained almost whole, and, as if to catch the falling\\r\\ndrop, Clarissa (crossing to the dressing-table) plunged into the very\\r\\nheart of the moment, transfixed it, there--the moment of this June\\r\\nmorning on which was the pressure of all the other mornings, seeing\\r\\nthe glass, the dressing-table, and all the bottles afresh, collecting\\r\\nthe whole of her at one point (as she looked into the glass), seeing\\r\\nthe delicate pink face of the woman who was that very night to give a\\r\\nparty; of Clarissa Dalloway; of herself. How many million times she had seen her face, and always with the\\r\\nsame imperceptible contraction! She pursed her lips when she looked\\r\\nin the glass. It was to give her face point. That was her\\r\\nself--pointed; dartlike; definite. That was her self when some\\r\\neffort, some call on her to be her self, drew the parts together, she\\r\\nalone knew how different, how incompatible and composed so for the\\r\\nworld only into one centre, one diamond, one woman who sat in her\\r\\ndrawing-room and made a meeting-point, a radiancy no doubt in some\\r\\ndull lives, a refuge for the lonely to come to, perhaps; she had\\r\\nhelped young people, who were grateful to her; had tried to be the\\r\\nsame always, never showing a sign of all the other sides of\\r\\nher--faults, jealousies, vanities, suspicions, like this of Lady\\r\\nBruton not asking her to lunch; which, she thought (combing her hair\\r\\nfinally), is utterly base! Now, where was her dress? Her evening dresses hung in the cupboard. Clarissa, plunging her\\r\\nhand into the softness, gently detached the green dress and carried\\r\\nit to the window. She had torn it. Some one had trod on the skirt.\\r\\nShe had felt it give at the Embassy party at the top among the folds.\\r\\nBy artificial light the green shone, but lost its colour now in the\\r\\nsun. She would mend it. Her maids had too much to do. She would wear\\r\\nit to-night. She would take her silks, her scissors, her--what was\\r\\nit?--her thimble, of course, down into the drawing-room, for she must\\r\\nalso write, and see that things generally were more or less in\\r\\norder. Strange, she thought, pausing on the landing, and assembling that\\r\\ndiamond shape, that single person, strange how a mistress knows the\\r\\nvery moment, the very temper of her house! Faint sounds rose in\\r\\nspirals up the well of the stairs; the swish of a mop; tapping;\\r\\nknocking; a loudness when the front door opened; a voice repeating a\\r\\nmessage in the basement; the chink of silver on a tray; clean silver\\r\\nfor the party. All was for the party. (And Lucy, coming into the drawing-room with her tray held out,\\r\\nput the giant candlesticks on the mantelpiece, the silver casket in\\r\\nthe middle, turned the crystal dolphin towards the clock. They would\\r\\ncome; they would stand; they would talk in the mincing tones which\\r\\nshe could imitate, ladies and gentlemen. Of all, her mistress was\\r\\nloveliest--mistress of silver, of linen, of china, for the sun, the\\r\\nsilver, doors off their hinges, Rumpelmayer\\'s men, gave her a sense,\\r\\nas she laid the paper-knife on the inlaid table, of something\\r\\nachieved. Behold! Behold! she said, speaking to her old friends in\\r\\nthe baker\\'s shop, where she had first seen service at Caterham,\\r\\nprying into the glass. She was Lady Angela, attending Princess Mary,\\r\\nwhen in came Mrs. Dalloway.) \"Oh Lucy,\" she said, \"the silver does look nice!\" \"And how,\" she said, turning the crystal dolphin to stand\\r\\nstraight, \"how did you enjoy the play last night?\" \"Oh, they had to\\r\\ngo before the end!\" she said. \"They had to be back at ten!\" she said.\\r\\n\"So they don\\'t know what happened,\" she said. \"That does seem hard\\r\\nluck,\" she said (for her servants stayed later, if they asked her).\\r\\n\"That does seem rather a shame,\" she said, taking the old\\r\\nbald-looking cushion in the middle of the sofa and putting it in\\r\\nLucy\\'s arms, and giving her a little push, and crying: \"Take it away! Give it to Mrs. Walker with my compliments! Take it\\r\\naway!\" she cried. And Lucy stopped at the drawing-room door, holding the cushion,\\r\\nand said, very shyly, turning a little pink, Couldn\\'t she help to\\r\\nmend that dress? But, said Mrs. Dalloway, she had enough on her hands already,\\r\\nquite enough of her own to do without that. \"But, thank you, Lucy, oh, thank you,\" said Mrs. Dalloway, and\\r\\nthank you, thank you, she went on saying (sitting down on the sofa\\r\\nwith her dress over her knees, her scissors, her silks), thank you,\\r\\nthank you, she went on saying in gratitude to her servants generally\\r\\nfor helping her to be like this, to be what she wanted, gentle,\\r\\ngenerous-hearted. Her servants liked her. And then this dress of\\r\\nhers--where was the tear? and now her needle to be threaded. This was\\r\\na favourite dress, one of Sally Parker\\'s, the last almost she ever\\r\\nmade, alas, for Sally had now retired, living at Ealing, and if ever\\r\\nI have a moment, thought Clarissa (but never would she have a moment\\r\\nany more), I shall go and see her at Ealing. For she was a character,\\r\\nthought Clarissa, a real artist. She thought of little out-of-the-way\\r\\nthings; yet her dresses were never queer. You could wear them at\\r\\nHatfield; at Buckingham Palace. She had worn them at Hatfield; at\\r\\nBuckingham Palace. Quiet descended on her, calm, content, as her needle, drawing the\\r\\nsilk smoothly to its gentle pause, collected the green folds together\\r\\nand attached them, very lightly, to the belt. So on a summer\\'s day\\r\\nwaves collect, overbalance, and fall; collect and fall; and the whole\\r\\nworld seems to be saying \"that is all\" more and more ponderously,\\r\\nuntil even the heart in the body which lies in the sun on the beach\\r\\nsays too, That is all. Fear no more, says the heart. Fear no more,\\r\\nsays the heart, committing its burden to some sea, which sighs\\r\\ncollectively for all sorrows, and renews, begins, collects, lets\\r\\nfall. And the body alone listens to the passing bee; the wave\\r\\nbreaking; the dog barking, far away barking and barking. \"Heavens, the front-door bell!\" exclaimed Clarissa, staying her\\r\\nneedle. Roused, she listened. \"Mrs. Dalloway will see me,\" said the elderly man in the hall. \"Oh\\r\\nyes, she will see   he repeated, putting Lucy aside very\\r\\nbenevolently, and running upstairs ever so quickly. \"Yes, yes, yes,\"\\r\\nhe muttered as he ran upstairs. \"She will see me. After five years in\\r\\nIndia, Clarissa will see me.\" \"Who can--what can,\" asked Mrs. Dalloway (thinking it was\\r\\noutrageous to be interrupted at eleven o\\'clock on the morning of the\\r\\nday she was giving a party), hearing a step on the stairs. She heard\\r\\na hand upon the door. She made to hide her dress, like a virgin\\r\\nprotecting chastity, respecting privacy. Now the brass knob slipped.\\r\\nNow the door opened, and in came--for a single second she could not\\r\\nremember what he was called! so surprised she was to see him, so\\r\\nglad, so shy, so utterly taken aback to have Peter Walsh come to her\\r\\nunexpectedly in the morning! (She had not read his letter.) \"And how are you?\" said Peter Walsh, positively trembling; taking\\r\\nboth her hands; kissing both her hands. She\\'s grown older, he\\r\\nthought, sitting down. I shan\\'t tell her anything about it, he\\r\\nthought, for she\\'s grown older. She\\'s looking at me, he thought, a\\r\\nsudden embarrassment coming over him, though he had kissed her hands.\\r\\nPutting his hand into his pocket, he took out a large pocket-knife\\r\\nand half opened the blade. Exactly the same, thought Clarissa; the same queer look; the same\\r\\ncheck suit; a little out of the straight his face is, a little\\r\\nthinner, dryer, perhaps, but he looks awfully well, and just the\\r\\nsame. \"How heavenly it is to see you again!\" she exclaimed. He had his\\r\\nknife out. That\\'s so like him, she thought. He had only reached town last night, he said; would have to go\\r\\ndown into the country at once; and how was everything, how was\\r\\neverybody--Richard? Elizabeth? \"And what\\'s all this?\" he said, tilting his pen-knife towards her\\r\\ngreen dress. He\\'s very well dressed, thought Clarissa; yet he always criticises\\r\\n Here she is mending her dress; mending her dress as usual, he\\r\\nthought; here she\\'s been sitting all the time I\\'ve been in India;\\r\\nmending her dress; playing about; going to parties; running to the\\r\\nHouse and back and all that, he thought, growing more and more\\r\\nirritated, more and more agitated, for there\\'s nothing in the world\\r\\nso bad for some women as marriage, he thought; and politics; and\\r\\nhaving a Conservative husband, like the admirable Richard. So it is,\\r\\nso it is, he thought, shutting his knife with a snap. \"Richard\\'s very well. Richard\\'s at a Committee,\" said\\r\\nClarissa. And she opened her scissors, and said, did he mind her just\\r\\nfinishing what she was doing to her dress, for they had a party that\\r\\nnight? \"Which I shan\\'t ask you to,\" she said. \"My dear Peter!\" she\\r\\nsaid. But it was delicious to hear her say that--my dear Peter! Indeed,\\r\\nit was all so delicious--the silver, the chairs; all so\\r\\ndelicious! Why wouldn\\'t she ask him to her party? he asked. Now of course, thought Clarissa, he\\'s enchanting! perfectly\\r\\nenchanting! Now I remember how impossible it was ever to make up my\\r\\nmind--and why did I make up my mind--not to marry him? she wondered,\\r\\nthat awful summer? \"But it\\'s so extraordinary that you should have come this\\r\\nmorning!\" she cried, putting her hands, one on top of another, down\\r\\non her dress. \"Do you remember,\" she said, \"how the blinds used to flap at\\r\\nBourton?\" \"They did,\" he said; and he remembered breakfasting alone, very\\r\\nawkwardly, with her father; who had died; and he had not written to\\r\\nClarissa. But he had never got on well with old Parry, that\\r\\nquerulous, weak-kneed old man, Clarissa\\'s father, Justin Parry. \"I often wish I\\'d got on better with your father,\" he said. \"But he never liked any one who--our friends,\" said Clarissa; and\\r\\ncould have bitten her tongue for thus reminding Peter that he had\\r\\nwanted to marry her. Of course I did, thought Peter; it almost broke my heart too, he\\r\\nthought; and was overcome with his own grief, which rose like a moon\\r\\nlooked at from a terrace, ghastly beautiful with light from the\\r\\nsunken day. I was more unhappy than I\\'ve ever been since, he thought.\\r\\nAnd as if in truth he were sitting there on the terrace he edged a\\r\\nlittle towards Clarissa; put his hand out; raised it; let it fall.\\r\\nThere above them it hung, that moon. She too seemed to be sitting\\r\\nwith him on the terrace, in the moonlight. \"Herbert has it now,\" she said. \"I never go there now,\" she\\r\\nsaid. Then, just as happens on a terrace in the moonlight, when one\\r\\nperson begins to feel ashamed that he is already bored, and yet as\\r\\nthe other sits silent, very quiet, sadly looking at the moon, does\\r\\nnot like to speak, moves his foot, clears his throat, notices some\\r\\niron scroll on a table leg, stirs a leaf, but says nothing--so Peter\\r\\nWalsh did now. For why go back like this to the past? he thought. Why\\r\\nmake him think of it again? Why make him suffer, when she had\\r\\ntortured him so infernally? Why? \"Do you remember the lake?\" she said, in an abrupt voice, under\\r\\nthe pressure of an emotion which caught her heart, made the muscles\\r\\nof her throat stiff, and contracted her lips in a spasm as she said\\r\\n\"lake.\" For she was a child, throwing bread to the ducks, between her\\r\\nparents, and at the same time a grown woman coming to her parents who\\r\\nstood by the lake, holding her life in her arms which, as she neared\\r\\nthem, grew larger and larger in her arms, until it became a whole\\r\\nlife, a complete life, which she put down by them and said, \"This is\\r\\nwhat I have made of it! This!\" And what had she made of it? What,\\r\\nindeed? sitting there sewing this morning with Peter. She looked at Peter Walsh; her look, passing through all that time\\r\\nand that emotion, reached him doubtfully; settled on him tearfully;\\r\\nand rose and fluttered away, as a bird touches a branch and rises and\\r\\nflutters away. Quite simply she wiped her eyes. \"Yes,\" said Peter. \"Yes, yes, yes,\" he said, as if she drew up to\\r\\nthe surface something which positively hurt him as it rose. Stop!\\r\\nStop! he wanted to cry. For he was not old; his life was not over;\\r\\nnot by any means. He was only just past fifty. Shall I tell her, he\\r\\nthought, or not? He would like to make a clean breast of it all. But\\r\\nshe is too cold, he thought; sewing, with her scissors; Daisy would\\r\\nlook ordinary beside Clarissa. And she would think me a failure,\\r\\nwhich I am in their sense, he thought; in the Dalloways\\' sense. Oh\\r\\nyes, he had no doubt about that; he was a failure, compared with all\\r\\nthis--the inlaid table, the mounted paper-knife, the dolphin and the\\r\\ncandlesticks, the chair-covers and the old valuable English tinted\\r\\nprints--he was a failure! I detest the smugness of the whole affair,\\r\\nhe thought; Richard\\'s doing, not Clarissa\\'s; save that she married\\r\\nhim. (Here Lucy came into the room, carrying silver, more silver, but\\r\\ncharming, slender, graceful she looked, he thought, as she stooped to\\r\\nput it down.) And this has been going on all the time! he thought;\\r\\nweek after week; Clarissa\\'s life; while I--he thought; and at once\\r\\neverything seemed to radiate from him; journeys; rides; quarrels;\\r\\nadventures; bridge parties; love affairs; work; work, work! and he\\r\\ntook out his knife quite openly--his old horn-handled knife which\\r\\nClarissa could swear he had had these thirty years--and clenched his\\r\\nfist upon it. What an extraordinary habit that was, Clarissa thought; always\\r\\nplaying with a knife. Always making one feel, too, frivolous;\\r\\nempty-minded; a mere silly chatterbox, as he used. But I too, she\\r\\nthought, and, taking up her needle, summoned, like a Queen whose\\r\\nguards have fallen asleep and left her unprotected (she had been\\r\\nquite taken aback by this visit--it had upset her) so that any one\\r\\ncan stroll in and have a look at her where she lies with the brambles\\r\\ncurving over her, summoned to her help the things she did; the things\\r\\nshe liked; her husband; Elizabeth; her self, in short, which Peter\\r\\nhardly knew now, all to come about her and beat off the enemy. \"Well, and what\\'s happened to you?\" she said. So before a battle\\r\\nbegins, the horses paw the ground; toss their heads; the light shines\\r\\non their flanks; their necks curve. So Peter Walsh and Clarissa,\\r\\nsitting side by side on the blue sofa, challenged each other. His\\r\\npowers chafed and tossed in him. He assembled from different quarters\\r\\nall sorts of things; praise; his career at Oxford; his marriage,\\r\\nwhich she knew nothing whatever about; how he had loved; and\\r\\naltogether done his job. \"Millions of things!\" he exclaimed, and, urged by the assembly of\\r\\npowers which were now charging this way and that and giving him the\\r\\nfeeling at once frightening and extremely exhilarating of being\\r\\nrushed through the air on the shoulders of people he could no longer\\r\\nsee, he raised his hands to his forehead. Clarissa sat very upright; drew in her breath. \"I am in love,\" he said, not to her however, but to some one\\r\\nraised up in the dark so that you could not touch her but must lay\\r\\nyour garland down on the grass in the dark. \"In love,\" he repeated, now speaking rather dryly to Clarissa\\r\\nDalloway; \"in love with a girl in India.\" He had deposited his\\r\\ngarland. Clarissa could make what she would of it. \"In love!\" she said. That he at his age should be sucked under in\\r\\nhis little bow-tie by that monster! And there\\'s no flesh on his neck;\\r\\nhis hands are red; and he\\'s six months older than I am! her eye\\r\\nflashed back to her; but in her heart she felt, all the same, he is\\r\\nin love. He has that, she felt; he is in love. But the indomitable egotism which for ever rides down the hosts\\r\\nopposed to it, the river which says on, on, on; even though, it\\r\\nadmits, there may be no goal for us whatever, still on, on; this\\r\\nindomitable egotism charged her cheeks with colour; made her look\\r\\nvery young; very pink; very bright-eyed as she sat with her dress\\r\\nupon her knee, and her needle held to the end of green silk,\\r\\ntrembling a little. He was in love! Not with her. With some younger\\r\\nwoman, of course. \"And who is she?\" she asked. Now this statue must be brought from its height and set down\\r\\nbetween them. \"A married woman, unfortunately,\" he said; \"the wife of a Major in\\r\\nthe Indian Army.\" And with a curious ironical sweetness he smiled as he placed her\\r\\nin this ridiculous way before Clarissa. (All the same, he is in love, thought Clarissa.) \"She has,\" he continued, very reasonably, \"two small children; a\\r\\nboy and a girl; and I have come over to see my lawyers about the\\r\\ndivorce.\" There they are! he thought. Do what you like with them, Clarissa!\\r\\nThere they are! And second by second it seemed to him that the wife\\r\\nof the Major in the Indian Army (his Daisy) and her two small\\r\\nchildren became more and more lovely as Clarissa looked at them; as\\r\\nif he had set light to a grey pellet on a plate and there had risen\\r\\nup a lovely tree in the brisk sea-salted air of their intimacy (for\\r\\nin some ways no one understood him, felt with him, as Clarissa\\r\\ndid)--their exquisite intimacy. She flattered him; she fooled him, thought Clarissa; shaping the\\r\\nwoman, the wife of the Major in the Indian Army, with three strokes\\r\\nof a knife. What a waste! What a folly! All his life long Peter had\\r\\nbeen fooled like that; first getting sent down from Oxford; next\\r\\nmarrying the girl on the boat going out to India; now the wife of a\\r\\nMajor in the Indian Army--thank Heaven she had refused to marry him!\\r\\nStill, he was in love; her old friend, her dear Peter, he was in\\r\\nlove. \"But what are you going to do?\" she asked him. Oh the lawyers and\\r\\nsolicitors, Messrs. Hooper and Grateley of Lincoln\\'s Inn, they were\\r\\ngoing to do it, he said. And he actually pared his nails with his\\r\\npocket-knife. For Heaven\\'s sake, leave your knife alone! she cried to herself in\\r\\nirrepressible irritation; it was his silly unconventionality, his\\r\\nweakness; his lack of the ghost of a notion what any one else was\\r\\nfeeling that annoyed her, had always annoyed her; and now at his age,\\r\\nhow silly! I know all that, Peter thought; I know what I\\'m up against, he\\r\\nthought, running his finger along the blade of his knife, Clarissa\\r\\nand Dalloway and all the rest of them; but I\\'ll show Clarissa--and\\r\\nthen to his utter surprise, suddenly thrown by those uncontrollable\\r\\nforces thrown through the air, he burst into tears; wept; wept\\r\\nwithout the least shame, sitting on the sofa, the tears running down\\r\\nhis cheeks. And Clarissa had leant forward, taken his hand, drawn him to her,\\r\\nkissed him,--actually had felt his face on hers before she could down\\r\\nthe brandishing of silver flashing--plumes like pampas grass in a\\r\\ntropic gale in her breast, which, subsiding, left her holding his\\r\\nhand, patting his knee and, feeling as she sat back extraordinarily\\r\\nat her ease with him and light-hearted, all in a clap it came over\\r\\nher, If I had married him, this gaiety would have been mine all\\r\\nday! It was all over for her. The sheet was stretched and the bed\\r\\nnarrow. She had gone up into the tower alone and left them\\r\\nblackberrying in the sun. The door had shut, and there among the dust\\r\\nof fallen plaster and the litter of birds\\' nests how distant the view\\r\\nhad looked, and the sounds came thin and chill (once on Leith Hill,\\r\\nshe remembered), and Richard, Richard! she cried, as a sleeper in the\\r\\nnight starts and stretches a hand in the dark for help. Lunching with\\r\\nLady Bruton, it came back to her. He has left me; I am alone for\\r\\never, she thought, folding her hands upon her knee. Peter Walsh had got up and crossed to the window and stood with\\r\\nhis back to her, flicking a bandanna handkerchief from side to side.\\r\\nMasterly and dry and desolate he looked, his thin shoulder-blades\\r\\nlifting his coat slightly; blowing his nose violently. Take me with\\r\\nyou, Clarissa thought impulsively, as if he were starting directly\\r\\nupon some great voyage; and then, next moment, it was as if the five\\r\\nacts of a play that had been very exciting and moving were now over\\r\\nand she had lived a lifetime in them and had run away, had lived with\\r\\nPeter, and it was now over. Now it was time to move, and, as a woman gathers her things\\r\\ntogether, her cloak, her gloves, her opera-glasses, and gets up to go\\r\\nout of the theatre into the street, she rose from the sofa and went\\r\\nto Peter. And it was awfully strange, he thought, how she still had the\\r\\npower, as she came tinkling, rustling, still had the power as she\\r\\ncame across the room, to make the moon, which he detested, rise at\\r\\nBourton on the terrace in the summer sky. \"Tell me,\" he said, seizing her by the shoulders. \"Are you happy,\\r\\nClarissa? Does Richard--\" The door opened. \"Here is my Elizabeth,\" said Clarissa, emotionally,\\r\\nhistrionically, perhaps. \"How d\\'y do?\" said Elizabeth coming forward. The sound of Big Ben striking the half-hour struck out between\\r\\nthem with extraordinary vigour, as if a young man, strong,\\r\\nindifferent, inconsiderate, were swinging dumb-bells this way and\\r\\nthat. \"Hullo, Elizabeth!\" cried Peter, stuffing his handkerchief into\\r\\nhis pocket, going quickly to her, saying \"Good-bye, Clarissa\" without\\r\\nlooking at her, leaving the room quickly, and running downstairs and\\r\\nopening the hall door. \"Peter! Peter!\" cried Clarissa, following him out on to the\\r\\nlanding. \"My party to-night! Remember my party to-night!\" she cried,\\r\\nhaving to raise her voice against the roar of the open air, and,\\r\\noverwhelmed by the traffic and the sound of all the clocks striking,\\r\\nher voice crying \"Remember my party to-night!\" sounded frail and thin\\r\\nand very far away as Peter Walsh shut the door. \\xa0 \\xa0 Remember my party, remember my party, said Peter Walsh as he\\r\\nstepped down the street, speaking to himself rhythmically, in time\\r\\nwith the flow of the sound, the direct downright sound of Big Ben\\r\\nstriking the half-hour. (The leaden circles dissolved in the air.) Oh\\r\\nthese parties, he thought; Clarissa\\'s parties. Why does she give\\r\\nthese parties, he thought. Not that he blamed her or this effigy of a\\r\\nman in a tail-coat with a carnation in his buttonhole coming towards\\r\\nhim. Only one person in the world could be as he was, in love. And\\r\\nthere he was, this fortunate man, himself, reflected in the\\r\\nplate-glass window of a motor-car manufacturer in Victoria Street.\\r\\nAll India lay behind him; plains, mountains; epidemics of cholera; a\\r\\ndistrict twice as big as Ireland; decisions he had come to alone--he,\\r\\nPeter Walsh; who was now really for the first time in his life, in\\r\\nlove. Clarissa had grown hard, he thought; and a trifle sentimental\\r\\ninto the bargain, he suspected, looking at the great motor-cars\\r\\ncapable of doing--how many miles on how many gallons? For he had a\\r\\nturn for mechanics; had invented a plough in his district, had\\r\\nordered wheel-barrows from England, but the coolies wouldn\\'t use\\r\\nthem, all of which Clarissa knew nothing whatever about. The way she said \"Here is my Elizabeth!\"--that annoyed him. Why\\r\\nnot \"Here\\'s Elizabeth\" simply? It was insincere. And Elizabeth didn\\'t\\r\\nlike it either. (Still the last tremors of the great booming voice\\r\\nshook the air round him; the half-hour; still early; only half-past\\r\\neleven still.) For he understood young people; he liked them. There\\r\\nwas always something cold in Clarissa, he thought. She had always,\\r\\neven as a girl, a sort of timidity, which in middle age becomes\\r\\nconventionality, and then it\\'s all up, it\\'s all up, he thought,\\r\\nlooking rather drearily into the glassy depths, and wondering whether\\r\\nby calling at that hour he had annoyed her; overcome with shame\\r\\nsuddenly at having been a fool; wept; been emotional; told her\\r\\neverything, as usual, as usual. As a cloud crosses the sun, silence falls on London; and falls on\\r\\nthe mind. Effort ceases. Time flaps on the mast. There we stop; there\\r\\nwe stand. Rigid, the skeleton of habit alone upholds the human frame.\\r\\nWhere there is nothing, Peter Walsh said to himself; feeling hollowed\\r\\nout, utterly empty within. Clarissa refused me, he thought. He stood\\r\\nthere thinking, Clarissa refused me. Ah, said St. Margaret\\'s, like a hostess who comes into her\\r\\ndrawing-room on the very stroke of the hour and finds her guests\\r\\nthere already. I am not late. No, it is precisely half-past eleven,\\r\\nshe says. Yet, though she is perfectly right, her voice, being the\\r\\nvoice of the hostess, is reluctant to inflict its individuality. Some\\r\\ngrief for the past holds it back; some concern for the present. It is\\r\\nhalf-past eleven, she says, and the sound of St. Margaret\\'s glides\\r\\ninto the recesses of the heart and buries itself in ring after ring\\r\\nof sound, like something alive which wants to confide itself, to\\r\\ndisperse itself, to be, with a tremor of delight, at rest--like\\r\\nClarissa herself, thought Peter Walsh, coming down the stairs on the\\r\\nstroke of the hour in white. It is Clarissa herself, he thought, with\\r\\na deep emotion, and an extraordinarily clear, yet puzzling,\\r\\nrecollection of her, as if this bell had come into the room years\\r\\nago, where they sat at some moment of great intimacy, and had gone\\r\\nfrom one to the other and had left, like a bee with honey, laden with\\r\\nthe moment. But what room? What moment? And why had he been so\\r\\nprofoundly happy when the clock was striking? Then, as the sound of\\r\\nSt. Margaret\\'s languished, he thought, She has been ill, and the\\r\\nsound expressed languor and suffering. It was her heart, he\\r\\nremembered; and the sudden loudness of the final stroke tolled for\\r\\ndeath that surprised in the midst of life, Clarissa falling where she\\r\\nstood, in her drawing-room. No! No! he cried. She is not dead! I am\\r\\nnot old, he cried, and marched up Whitehall, as if there rolled down\\r\\nto him, vigorous, unending, his future. He was not old, or set, or dried in the least. As for caring what\\r\\nthey said of him--the Dalloways, the Whitbreads, and their set, he\\r\\ncared not a straw--not a straw (though it was true he would have,\\r\\nsome time or other, to see whether Richard couldn\\'t help him to some\\r\\njob). Striding, staring, he glared at the statue of the Duke of\\r\\nCambridge. He had been sent down from Oxford--true. He had been a\\r\\nSocialist, in some sense a failure--true. Still the future of\\r\\ncivilisation lies, he thought, in the hands of young men like that;\\r\\nof young men such as he was, thirty years ago; with their love of\\r\\nabstract principles; getting books sent out to them all the way from\\r\\nLondon to a peak in the Himalayas; reading science; reading\\r\\nphilosophy. The future lies in the hands of young men like that, he\\r\\nthought. A patter like the patter of leaves in a wood came from behind, and\\r\\nwith it a rustling, regular thudding sound, which as it overtook him\\r\\ndrummed his thoughts, strict in step, up Whitehall, without his\\r\\ndoing. Boys in uniform, carrying guns, marched with their eyes ahead\\r\\nof them, marched, their arms stiff, and on their faces an expression\\r\\nlike the letters of a legend written round the base of a statue\\r\\npraising duty, gratitude, fidelity, love of England. It is, thought Peter Walsh, beginning to keep step with them, a\\r\\nvery fine training. But they did not look robust. They were weedy for\\r\\nthe most part, boys of sixteen, who might, to-morrow, stand behind\\r\\nbowls of rice, cakes of soap on counters. Now they wore on them\\r\\nunmixed with sensual pleasure or daily preoccupations the solemnity\\r\\nof the wreath which they had fetched from Finsbury Pavement to the\\r\\nempty tomb. They had taken their vow. The traffic respected it; vans\\r\\nwere stopped. I can\\'t keep up with them, Peter Walsh thought, as they marched up\\r\\nWhitehall, and sure enough, on they marched, past him, past every\\r\\none, in their steady way, as if one will worked legs and arms\\r\\nuniformly, and life, with its varieties, its irreticences, had been\\r\\nlaid under a pavement of monuments and wreaths and drugged into a\\r\\nstiff yet staring corpse by discipline. One had to respect it; one\\r\\nmight laugh; but one had to respect it, he thought. There they go,\\r\\nthought Peter Walsh, pausing at the edge of the pavement; and all the\\r\\nexalted statues, Nelson, Gordon, Havelock, the black, the spectacular\\r\\nimages of great soldiers stood looking ahead of them, as if they too\\r\\nhad made the same renunciation (Peter Walsh felt he too had made it,\\r\\nthe great renunciation), trampled under the same temptations, and\\r\\nachieved at length a marble stare. But the stare Peter Walsh did not\\r\\nwant for himself in the least; though he could respect it in others.\\r\\nHe could respect it in boys. They don\\'t know the troubles of the\\r\\nflesh yet, he thought, as the marching boys disappeared in the\\r\\ndirection of the Strand--all that I\\'ve been through, he thought,\\r\\ncrossing the road, and standing under Gordon\\'s statue, Gordon whom as\\r\\na boy he had worshipped; Gordon standing lonely with one leg raised\\r\\nand his arms crossed,--poor Gordon, he thought. And just because nobody yet knew he was in London, except\\r\\nClarissa, and the earth, after the voyage, still seemed an island to\\r\\nhim, the strangeness of standing alone, alive, unknown, at half-past\\r\\neleven in Trafalgar Square overcame him. What is it? Where am I? And\\r\\nwhy, after all, does one do it? he thought, the divorce seeming all\\r\\nmoonshine. And down his mind went flat as a marsh, and three great\\r\\nemotions bowled over him; understanding; a vast philanthropy; and\\r\\nfinally, as if the result of the others, an irrepressible, exquisite\\r\\ndelight; as if inside his brain by another hand strings were pulled,\\r\\nshutters moved, and he, having nothing to do with it, yet stood at\\r\\nthe opening of endless avenues, down which if he chose he might\\r\\nwander. He had not felt so young for years. He had escaped! was utterly free--as happens in the downfall of\\r\\nhabit when the mind, like an unguarded flame, bows and bends and\\r\\nseems about to blow from its holding. I haven\\'t felt so young for\\r\\nyears! thought Peter, escaping (only of course for an hour or so)\\r\\nfrom being precisely what he was, and feeling like a child who runs\\r\\nout of doors, and sees, as he runs, his old nurse waving at the wrong\\r\\nwindow. But she\\'s extraordinarily attractive, he thought, as, walking\\r\\nacross Trafalgar Square in the direction of the Haymarket, came a\\r\\nyoung woman who, as she passed Gordon\\'s statue, seemed, Peter Walsh\\r\\nthought (susceptible as he was), to shed veil after veil, until she\\r\\nbecame the very woman he had always had in mind; young, but stately;\\r\\nmerry, but discreet; black, but enchanting. Straightening himself and stealthily fingering his pocket-knife he\\r\\nstarted after her to follow this woman, this excitement, which seemed\\r\\neven with its back turned to shed on him a light which connected\\r\\nthem, which singled him out, as if the random uproar of the traffic\\r\\nhad whispered through hollowed hands his name, not Peter, but his\\r\\nprivate name which he called himself in his own thoughts. \"You,\" she\\r\\nsaid, only \"you,\" saying it with her white gloves and her shoulders.\\r\\nThen the thin long cloak which the wind stirred as she walked past\\r\\nDent\\'s shop in Cockspur Street blew out with an enveloping kindness,\\r\\na mournful tenderness, as of arms that would open and take the\\r\\ntired-- But she\\'s not married; she\\'s young; quite young, thought Peter,\\r\\nthe red carnation he had seen her wear as she came across Trafalgar\\r\\nSquare burning again in his eyes and making her lips red. But she\\r\\nwaited at the kerbstone. There was a dignity about her. She was not\\r\\nworldly, like Clarissa; not rich, like Clarissa. Was she, he wondered\\r\\nas she moved, respectable? Witty, with a lizard\\'s flickering tongue,\\r\\nhe thought (for one must invent, must allow oneself a little\\r\\ndiversion), a cool waiting wit, a darting wit; not noisy. She moved; she crossed; he followed her. To embarrass her was the\\r\\nlast thing he wished. Still if she stopped he would say \"Come and\\r\\nhave an ice,\" he would say, and she would answer, perfectly simply,\\r\\n\"Oh yes.\" But other people got between them in the street, obstructing him,\\r\\nblotting her out. He pursued; she changed. There was colour in her\\r\\ncheeks; mockery in her eyes; he was an adventurer, reckless, he\\r\\nthought, swift, daring, indeed (landed as he was last night from\\r\\nIndia) a romantic buccaneer, careless of all these damned\\r\\nproprieties, yellow dressing-gowns, pipes, fishing-rods, in the shop\\r\\nwindows; and respectability and evening parties and spruce old men\\r\\nwearing white slips beneath their waistcoats. He was a buccaneer. On\\r\\nand on she went, across Piccadilly, and up Regent Street, ahead of\\r\\nhim, her cloak, her gloves, her shoulders combining with the fringes\\r\\nand the laces and the feather boas in the windows to make the spirit\\r\\nof finery and whimsy which dwindled out of the shops on to the\\r\\npavement, as the light of a lamp goes wavering at night over hedges\\r\\nin the darkness. Laughing and delightful, she had crossed Oxford Street and Great\\r\\nPortland Street and turned down one of the little streets, and now,\\r\\nand now, the great moment was approaching, for now she slackened,\\r\\nopened her bag, and with one look in his direction, but not at him,\\r\\none look that bade farewell, summed up the whole situation and\\r\\ndismissed it triumphantly, for ever, had fitted her key, opened the\\r\\ndoor, and gone! Clarissa\\'s voice saying, Remember my party, Remember\\r\\nmy party, sang in his ears. The house was one of those flat red\\r\\nhouses with hanging flower-baskets of vague impropriety. It was\\r\\nover. Well, I\\'ve had my fun; I\\'ve had it, he thought, looking up at the\\r\\nswinging baskets of pale geraniums. And it was smashed to atoms--his\\r\\nfun, for it was half made up, as he knew very well; invented, this\\r\\nescapade with the girl; made up, as one makes up the better part of\\r\\nlife, he thought--making oneself up; making her up; creating an\\r\\nexquisite amusement, and something more. But odd it was, and quite\\r\\ntrue; all this one could never share--it smashed to atoms. He turned; went up the street, thinking to find somewhere to sit,\\r\\ntill it was time for Lincoln\\'s Inn--for Messrs. Hooper and Grateley.\\r\\nWhere should he go? No matter. Up the street, then, towards Regent\\'s\\r\\nPark. His boots on the pavement struck out \"no matter\"; for it was\\r\\nearly, still very early. It was a splendid morning too. Like the pulse of a perfect heart,\\r\\nlife struck straight through the streets. There was no fumbling--no\\r\\nhesitation. Sweeping and swerving, accurately, punctually,\\r\\nnoiselessly, there, precisely at the right instant, the motor-car\\r\\nstopped at the door. The girl, silk-stockinged, feathered,\\r\\nevanescent, but not to him particularly attractive (for he had had\\r\\nhis fling), alighted. Admirable butlers, tawny chow dogs, halls laid\\r\\nin black and white lozenges with white blinds blowing, Peter saw\\r\\nthrough the opened door and approved of. A splendid achievement in\\r\\nits own way, after all, London; the season; civilisation. Coming as\\r\\nhe did from a respectable Anglo-Indian family which for at least\\r\\nthree generations had administered the affairs of a continent (it\\'s\\r\\nstrange, he thought, what a sentiment I have about that, disliking\\r\\nIndia, and empire, and army as he did), there were moments when\\r\\ncivilisation, even of this sort, seemed dear to him as a personal\\r\\npossession; moments of pride in England; in butlers; chow dogs; girls\\r\\nin their security. Ridiculous enough, still there it is, he thought.\\r\\nAnd the doctors and men of business and capable women all going about\\r\\ntheir business, punctual, alert, robust, seemed to him wholly\\r\\nadmirable, good fellows, to whom one would entrust one\\'s life,\\r\\ncompanions in the art of living, who would see one through. What with\\r\\none thing and another, the show was really very tolerable; and he\\r\\nwould sit down in the shade and smoke. There was Regent\\'s Park. Yes. As a child he had walked in Regent\\'s\\r\\nPark--odd, he thought, how the thought of childhood keeps coming back\\r\\nto me--the result of seeing Clarissa, perhaps; for women live much\\r\\nmore in the past than we do, he thought. They attach themselves to\\r\\nplaces; and their fathers--a woman\\'s always proud of her father.\\r\\nBourton was a nice place, a very nice place, but I could never get on\\r\\nwith the old man, he thought. There was quite a scene one night--an\\r\\nargument about something or other, what, he could not remember.\\r\\nPolitics presumably. Yes, he remembered Regent\\'s Park; the long straight walk; the\\r\\nlittle house where one bought air-balls to the left; an absurd statue\\r\\nwith an inscription somewhere or other. He looked for an empty seat.\\r\\nHe did not want to be bothered (feeling a little drowsy as he did) by\\r\\npeople asking him the time. An elderly grey nurse, with a baby asleep\\r\\nin its perambulator--that was the best he could do for himself; sit\\r\\ndown at the far end of the seat by that nurse. She\\'s a queer-looking girl, he thought, suddenly remembering\\r\\nElizabeth as she came into the room and stood by her mother. Grown\\r\\nbig; quite grown-up, not exactly pretty; handsome rather; and she\\r\\ncan\\'t be more than eighteen. Probably she doesn\\'t get on with\\r\\nClarissa. \"There\\'s my Elizabeth\"--that sort of thing--why not \"Here\\'s\\r\\nElizabeth\" simply?--trying to make out, like most mothers, that\\r\\nthings are what they\\'re not. She trusts to her charm too much, he\\r\\nthought. She overdoes it. The rich benignant cigar smoke eddied coolly down his throat; he\\r\\npuffed it out again in rings which breasted the air bravely for a\\r\\nmoment; blue, circular--I shall try and get a word alone with\\r\\nElizabeth to-night, he thought--then began to wobble into hour-glass\\r\\nshapes and taper away; odd shapes they take, he thought. Suddenly he\\r\\nclosed his eyes, raised his hand with an effort, and threw away the\\r\\nheavy end of his cigar. A great brush swept smooth across his mind,\\r\\nsweeping across it moving branches, children\\'s voices, the shuffle of\\r\\nfeet, and people passing, and humming traffic, rising and falling\\r\\ntraffic. Down, down he sank into the plumes and feathers of sleep,\\r\\nsank, and was muffled over. \\xa0 \\xa0 The grey nurse resumed her knitting as Peter Walsh, on the hot\\r\\nseat beside her, began snoring. In her grey dress, moving her hands\\r\\nindefatigably yet quietly, she seemed like the champion of the rights\\r\\nof sleepers, like one of those spectral presences which rise in\\r\\ntwilight in woods made of sky and branches. The solitary traveller,\\r\\nhaunter of lanes, disturber of ferns, and devastator of great hemlock\\r\\nplants, looking up, suddenly sees the giant figure at the end of the\\r\\nride. By conviction an atheist perhaps, he is taken by surprise with\\r\\nmoments of extraordinary exaltation. Nothing exists outside us except\\r\\na state of mind, he thinks; a desire for solace, for relief, for\\r\\nsomething outside these miserable pigmies, these feeble, these ugly,\\r\\nthese craven men and women. But if he can conceive of her, then in\\r\\nsome sort she exists, he thinks, and advancing down the path with his\\r\\neyes upon sky and branches he rapidly endows them with womanhood;\\r\\nsees with amazement how grave they become; how majestically, as the\\r\\nbreeze stirs them, they dispense with a dark flutter of the leaves\\r\\ncharity, comprehension, absolution, and then, flinging themselves\\r\\nsuddenly aloft, confound the piety of their aspect with a wild\\r\\ncarouse. Such are the visions which proffer great cornucopias full of fruit\\r\\nto the solitary traveller, or murmur in his ear like sirens lolloping\\r\\naway on the green sea waves, or are dashed in his face like bunches\\r\\nof roses, or rise to the surface like pale faces which fishermen\\r\\nflounder through floods to embrace. Such are the visions which ceaselessly float up, pace beside, put\\r\\ntheir faces in front of, the actual thing; often overpowering the\\r\\nsolitary traveller and taking away from him the sense of the earth,\\r\\nthe wish to return, and giving him for substitute a general peace, as\\r\\nif (so he thinks as he advances down the forest ride) all this fever\\r\\nof living were simplicity itself; and myriads of things merged in one\\r\\nthing; and this figure, made of sky and branches as it is, had risen\\r\\nfrom the troubled sea (he is elderly, past fifty now) as a shape\\r\\nmight be sucked up out of the waves to shower down from her\\r\\nmagnificent hands compassion, comprehension, absolution. So, he\\r\\nthinks, may I never go back to the lamplight; to the sitting-room;\\r\\nnever finish my book; never knock out my pipe; never ring for Mrs.\\r\\nTurner to clear away; rather let me walk straight on to this great\\r\\nfigure, who will, with a toss of her head, mount me on her streamers\\r\\nand let me blow to nothingness with the rest. Such are the visions. The solitary traveller is soon beyond the\\r\\nwood; and there, coming to the door with shaded eyes, possibly to\\r\\nlook for his return, with hands raised, with white apron blowing, is\\r\\nan elderly woman who seems (so powerful is this infirmity) to seek,\\r\\nover a desert, a lost son; to search for a rider destroyed; to be the\\r\\nfigure of the mother whose sons have been killed in the battles of\\r\\nthe world. So, as the solitary traveller advances down the village\\r\\nstreet where the women stand knitting and the men dig in the garden,\\r\\nthe evening seems ominous; the figures still; as if some august fate,\\r\\nknown to them, awaited without fear, were about to sweep them into\\r\\ncomplete annihilation. Indoors among ordinary things, the cupboard, the table, the\\r\\nwindow-sill with its geraniums, suddenly the outline of the landlady,\\r\\nbending to remove the cloth, becomes soft with light, an adorable\\r\\nemblem which only the recollection of cold human contacts forbids us\\r\\nto embrace. She takes the marmalade; she shuts it in the\\r\\ncupboard. \"There is nothing more to-night, sir?\" But to whom does the solitary traveller make reply? \\xa0 \\xa0 So the elderly nurse knitted over the sleeping baby in Regent\\'s\\r\\nPark. So Peter Walsh snored. He woke with extreme suddenness, saying to himself, \"The death of\\r\\nthe soul.\" \"Lord, Lord!\" he said to himself out loud, stretching and opening\\r\\nhis eyes. \"The death of the soul.\" The words attached themselves to\\r\\nsome scene, to some room, to some past he had been dreaming of. It\\r\\nbecame clearer; the scene, the room, the past he had been dreaming\\r\\nof. It was at Bourton that summer, early in the \\'nineties, when he was\\r\\nso passionately in love with Clarissa. There were a great many people\\r\\nthere, laughing and talking, sitting round a table after tea and the\\r\\nroom was bathed in yellow light and full of cigarette smoke. They\\r\\nwere talking about a man who had married his housemaid, one of the\\r\\nneighbouring squires, he had forgotten his name. He had married his\\r\\nhousemaid, and she had been brought to Bourton to call--an awful\\r\\nvisit it had been. She was absurdly over-dressed, \"like a cockatoo,\"\\r\\nClarissa had said, imitating her, and she never stopped talking. On\\r\\nand on she went, on and on. Clarissa imitated her. Then somebody\\r\\nsaid--Sally Seton it was--did it make any real difference to one\\'s\\r\\nfeelings to know that before they\\'d married she had had a baby? (In\\r\\nthose days, in mixed company, it was a bold thing to say.) He could\\r\\nsee Clarissa now, turning bright pink; somehow contracting; and\\r\\nsaying, \"Oh, I shall never be able to speak to her again!\" Whereupon\\r\\nthe whole party sitting round the tea-table seemed to wobble. It was\\r\\nvery uncomfortable. He hadn\\'t blamed her for minding the fact, since in those days a\\r\\ngirl brought up as she was, knew nothing, but it was her manner that\\r\\nannoyed him; timid; hard; something arrogant; unimaginative; prudish.\\r\\n\"The death of the soul.\" He had said that instinctively, ticketing\\r\\nthe moment as he used to do--the death of her soul. Every one wobbled; every one seemed to bow, as she spoke, and then\\r\\nto stand up different. He could see Sally Seton, like a child who has\\r\\nbeen in mischief, leaning forward, rather flushed, wanting to talk,\\r\\nbut afraid, and Clarissa did frighten people. (She was Clarissa\\'s\\r\\ngreatest friend, always about the place, totally unlike her, an\\r\\nattractive creature, handsome, dark, with the reputation in those\\r\\ndays of great daring and he used to give her cigars, which she smoked\\r\\nin her bedroom. She had either been engaged to somebody or quarrelled\\r\\nwith her family and old Parry disliked them both equally, which was a\\r\\ngreat bond.) Then Clarissa, still with an air of being offended with\\r\\nthem all, got up, made some excuse, and went off, alone. As she\\r\\nopened the door, in came that great shaggy dog which ran after sheep.\\r\\nShe flung herself upon him, went into raptures. It was as if she said\\r\\nto Peter--it was all aimed at him, he knew--\"I know you thought me\\r\\nabsurd about that woman just now; but see how extraordinarily\\r\\nsympathetic I am; see how I love my Rob!\" They had always this queer power of communicating without words.\\r\\nShe knew directly he criticised her. Then she would do something\\r\\nquite obvious to defend herself, like this fuss with the dog--but it\\r\\nnever took him in, he always saw through Clarissa. Not that he said\\r\\nanything, of course; just sat looking glum. It was the way their\\r\\nquarrels often began. She shut the door. At once he became extremely depressed. It all\\r\\nseemed useless--going on being in love; going on quarrelling; going\\r\\non making it up, and he wandered off alone, among outhouses, stables,\\r\\nlooking at the horses. (The place was quite a humble one; the Parrys\\r\\nwere never very well off; but there were always grooms and\\r\\nstable-boys about--Clarissa loved riding--and an old coachman--what\\r\\nwas his name?--an old nurse, old Moody, old Goody, some such name\\r\\nthey called her, whom one was taken to visit in a little room with\\r\\nlots of photographs, lots of bird-cages.) It was an awful evening! He grew more and more gloomy, not about\\r\\nthat only; about everything. And he couldn\\'t see her; couldn\\'t\\r\\nexplain to her; couldn\\'t have it out. There were always people\\r\\nabout--she\\'d go on as if nothing had happened. That was the devilish\\r\\npart of her--this coldness, this woodenness, something very profound\\r\\nin her, which he had felt again this morning talking to her; an\\r\\nimpenetrability. Yet Heaven knows he loved her. She had some queer\\r\\npower of fiddling on one\\'s nerves, turning one\\'s nerves to\\r\\nfiddle-strings, yes. He had gone in to dinner rather late, from some idiotic idea of\\r\\nmaking himself felt, and had sat down by old Miss Parry--Aunt\\r\\nHelena--Mr. Parry\\'s sister, who was supposed to preside. There she\\r\\nsat in her white Cashmere shawl, with her head against the window--a\\r\\nformidable old lady, but kind to him, for he had found her some rare\\r\\nflower, and she was a great botanist, marching off in thick boots\\r\\nwith a black collecting-box slung between her shoulders. He sat down\\r\\nbeside her, and couldn\\'t speak. Everything seemed to race past him;\\r\\nhe just sat there, eating. And then half-way through dinner he made\\r\\nhimself look across at Clarissa for the first time. She was talking\\r\\nto a young man on her right. He had a sudden revelation. \"She will\\r\\nmarry that man,\" he said to himself. He didn\\'t even know his\\r\\nname. For of course it was that afternoon, that very afternoon, that\\r\\nDalloway had come over; and Clarissa called him \"Wickham\"; that was\\r\\nthe beginning of it all. Somebody had brought him over; and Clarissa\\r\\ngot his name wrong. She introduced him to everybody as Wickham. At\\r\\nlast he said \"My name is Dalloway!\"--that was his first view of\\r\\nRichard--a fair young man, rather awkward, sitting on a deck-chair,\\r\\nand blurting out \"My name is Dalloway!\" Sally got hold of it; always\\r\\nafter that she called him \"My name is Dalloway!\" He was a prey to revelations at that time. This one--that she\\r\\nwould marry Dalloway--was blinding--overwhelming at the moment. There\\r\\nwas a sort of--how could he put it?--a sort of ease in her manner to\\r\\nhim; something maternal; something gentle. They were talking about\\r\\npolitics. All through dinner he tried to hear what they were\\r\\nsaying. Afterwards he could remember standing by old Miss Parry\\'s chair in\\r\\nthe drawing-room. Clarissa came up, with her perfect manners, like a\\r\\nreal hostess, and wanted to introduce him to some one--spoke as if\\r\\nthey had never met before, which enraged him. Yet even then he\\r\\nadmired her for it. He admired her courage; her social instinct; he\\r\\nadmired her power of carrying things through. \"The perfect hostess,\"\\r\\nhe said to her, whereupon she winced all over. But he meant her to\\r\\nfeel it. He would have done anything to hurt her after seeing her\\r\\nwith Dalloway. So she left him. And he had a feeling that they were\\r\\nall gathered together in a conspiracy against him--laughing and\\r\\ntalking--behind his back. There he stood by Miss Parry\\'s chair as\\r\\nthough he had been cut out of wood, he talking about wild flowers.\\r\\nNever, never had he suffered so infernally! He must have forgotten\\r\\neven to pretend to listen; at last he woke up; he saw Miss Parry\\r\\nlooking rather disturbed, rather indignant, with her prominent eyes\\r\\nfixed. He almost cried out that he couldn\\'t attend because he was in\\r\\nHell! People began going out of the room. He heard them talking about\\r\\nfetching cloaks; about its being cold on the water, and so on. They\\r\\nwere going boating on the lake by moonlight--one of Sally\\'s mad\\r\\nideas. He could hear her describing the moon. And they all went out.\\r\\nHe was left quite alone. \"Don\\'t you want to go with them?\" said Aunt Helena--old Miss\\r\\nParry!--she had guessed. And he turned round and there was Clarissa\\r\\nagain. She had come back to fetch him. He was overcome by her\\r\\ngenerosity--her goodness. \"Come along,\" she said. \"They\\'re waiting.\" He had never felt so\\r\\nhappy in the whole of his life! Without a word they made it up. They\\r\\nwalked down to the lake. He had twenty minutes of perfect happiness.\\r\\nHer voice, her laugh, her dress (something floating, white, crimson),\\r\\nher spirit, her adventurousness; she made them all disembark and\\r\\nexplore the island; she startled a hen; she laughed; she sang. And\\r\\nall the time, he knew perfectly well, Dalloway was falling in love\\r\\nwith her; she was falling in love with Dalloway; but it didn\\'t seem\\r\\nto matter. Nothing mattered. They sat on the ground and talked--he\\r\\nand Clarissa. They went in and out of each other\\'s minds without any\\r\\neffort. And then in a second it was over. He said to himself as they\\r\\nwere getting into the boat, \"She will marry that man,\" dully, without\\r\\nany resentment; but it was an obvious thing. Dalloway would marry\\r\\nClarissa. Dalloway rowed them in. He said nothing. But somehow as they\\r\\nwatched him start, jumping on to his bicycle to ride twenty miles\\r\\nthrough the woods, wobbling off down the drive, waving his hand and\\r\\ndisappearing, he obviously did feel, instinctively, tremendously,\\r\\nstrongly, all that; the night; the romance; Clarissa. He deserved to\\r\\nhave her. For himself, he was absurd. His demands upon Clarissa (he could\\r\\nsee it now) were absurd. He asked impossible things. He made terrible\\r\\nscenes. She would have accepted him still, perhaps, if he had been\\r\\nless absurd. Sally thought so. She wrote him all that summer long\\r\\nletters; how they had talked of him; how she had praised him, how\\r\\nClarissa burst into tears! It was an extraordinary summer--all\\r\\nletters, scenes, telegrams--arriving at Bourton early in the morning,\\r\\nhanging about till the servants were up; appalling\\r\\n  with old Mr. Parry at\\r\\nbreakfast; Aunt Helena formidable but kind; Sally sweeping him off\\r\\nfor talks in the vegetable garden; Clarissa in bed with\\r\\nheadaches. The final scene, the terrible scene which he believed had mattered\\r\\nmore than anything in the whole of his life (it might be an\\r\\nexaggeration--but still so it did seem now) happened at three o\\'clock\\r\\nin the afternoon of a very hot day. It was a trifle that led up to\\r\\nit--Sally at lunch saying something about Dalloway, and calling him\\r\\n\"My name is Dalloway\"; whereupon Clarissa suddenly stiffened,\\r\\ncoloured, in a way she had, and rapped out sharply, \"We\\'ve had enough\\r\\nof that feeble joke.\" That was all; but for him it was precisely as\\r\\nif she had said, \"I\\'m only amusing myself with you; I\\'ve an\\r\\nunderstanding with Richard Dalloway.\" So he took it. He had not slept\\r\\nfor nights. \"It\\'s got to be finished one way or the other,\" he said\\r\\nto himself. He sent a note to her by Sally asking her to meet him by\\r\\nthe fountain at three. \"Something very important has happened,\" he\\r\\nscribbled at the end of it. The fountain was in the middle of a little shrubbery, far from the\\r\\nhouse, with shrubs and trees all round it. There she came, even\\r\\nbefore the time, and they stood with the fountain between them, the\\r\\nspout (it was broken) dribbling water incessantly. How sights fix\\r\\nthemselves upon the mind! For example, the vivid green moss. She did not move. \"Tell me the truth, tell me the truth,\" he kept\\r\\non saying. He felt as if his forehead would burst. She seemed\\r\\ncontracted, petrified. She did not move. \"Tell me the truth,\" he\\r\\nrepeated, when suddenly that old man Breitkopf popped his head in\\r\\ncarrying the   stared at them; gaped; and went away. They\\r\\nneither of them moved. \"Tell me the truth,\" he repeated. He felt that\\r\\nhe was grinding against something physically hard; she was\\r\\nunyielding. She was like iron, like flint, rigid up the backbone. And\\r\\nwhen she said, \"It\\'s no use. It\\'s no use. This is the end\"--after he\\r\\nhad spoken for hours, it seemed, with the tears running down his\\r\\ncheeks--it was as if she had hit him in the face. She turned, she\\r\\nleft him, went away. \"Clarissa!\" he cried. \"Clarissa!\" But she never came back. It was\\r\\nover. He went away that night. He never saw her again. \\xa0 \\xa0 It was awful, he cried, awful, awful! Still, the sun was hot. Still, one got over things. Still, life\\r\\nhad a way of adding day to day. Still, he thought, yawning and\\r\\nbeginning to take notice--Regent\\'s Park had changed very little since\\r\\nhe was a boy, except for the squirrels--still, presumably there were\\r\\ncompensations--when little Elise Mitchell, who had been picking up\\r\\npebbles to add to the pebble collection which she and her brother\\r\\nwere making on the nursery mantelpiece, plumped her handful down on\\r\\nthe nurse\\'s knee and scudded off again full tilt into a lady\\'s legs.\\r\\nPeter Walsh laughed out. But Lucrezia Warren Smith was saying to herself, It\\'s wicked; why\\r\\nshould I suffer? she was asking, as she walked down the broad path.\\r\\nNo; I can\\'t stand it any longer, she was saying, having left\\r\\nSeptimus, who wasn\\'t Septimus any longer, to say hard, cruel, wicked\\r\\nthings, to talk to himself, to talk to a dead man, on the seat over\\r\\nthere; when the child ran full tilt into her, fell flat, and burst\\r\\nout crying. That was comforting rather. She stood her upright, dusted her\\r\\nfrock, kissed her. But for herself she had done nothing wrong; she had loved\\r\\nSeptimus; she had been happy; she had had a beautiful home, and there\\r\\nher sisters lived still, making hats. Why should  \\r\\nsuffer? The child ran straight back to its nurse, and Rezia saw her\\r\\nscolded, comforted, taken up by the nurse who put down her knitting,\\r\\nand the kind-looking man gave her his watch to blow open to comfort\\r\\nher--but why should   be exposed? Why not left in Milan? Why\\r\\ntortured? Why? Slightly waved by tears the broad path, the nurse, the man in\\r\\ngrey, the perambulator, rose and fell before her eyes. To be rocked\\r\\nby this malignant torturer was her lot. But why? She was like a bird\\r\\nsheltering under the thin hollow of a leaf, who blinks at the sun\\r\\nwhen the leaf moves; starts at the crack of a dry twig. She was\\r\\nexposed; she was surrounded by the enormous trees, vast clouds of an\\r\\nindifferent world, exposed; tortured; and why should she suffer?\\r\\nWhy? She frowned; she stamped her foot. She must go back again to\\r\\nSeptimus since it was almost time for them to be going to Sir William\\r\\nBradshaw. She must go back and tell him, go back to him sitting there\\r\\non the green chair under the tree, talking to himself, or to that\\r\\ndead man Evans, whom she had only seen once for a moment in the shop.\\r\\nHe had seemed a nice quiet man; a great friend of Septimus\\'s, and he\\r\\nhad been killed in the War. But such things happen to every one.\\r\\nEvery one has friends who were killed in the War. Every one gives up\\r\\nsomething when they marry. She had given up her home. She had come to\\r\\nlive here, in this awful city. But Septimus let himself think about\\r\\nhorrible things, as she could too, if she tried. He had grown\\r\\nstranger and stranger. He said people were talking behind the bedroom\\r\\nwalls. Mrs. Filmer thought it odd. He saw things too--he had seen an\\r\\nold woman\\'s head in the middle of a fern. Yet he could be happy when\\r\\nhe chose. They went to Hampton Court on top of a bus, and they were\\r\\nperfectly happy. All the little red and yellow flowers were out on\\r\\nthe grass, like floating lamps he said, and talked and chattered and\\r\\nlaughed, making up stories. Suddenly he said, \"Now we will kill\\r\\nourselves,\" when they were standing by the river, and he looked at it\\r\\nwith a look which she had seen in his eyes when a train went by, or\\r\\nan omnibus--a look as if something fascinated him; and she felt he\\r\\nwas going from her and she caught him by the arm. But going home he\\r\\nwas perfectly quiet--perfectly reasonable. He would argue with her\\r\\nabout killing themselves; and explain how wicked people were; how he\\r\\ncould see them making up lies as they passed in the street. He knew\\r\\nall their thoughts, he said; he knew everything. He knew the meaning\\r\\nof the world, he said. Then when they got back he could hardly walk. He lay on the sofa\\r\\nand made her hold his hand to prevent him from falling down, down, he\\r\\ncried, into the flames! and saw faces laughing at him, calling him\\r\\nhorrible disgusting names, from the walls, and hands pointing round\\r\\nthe screen. Yet they were quite alone. But he began to talk aloud,\\r\\nanswering people, arguing, laughing, crying, getting very excited and\\r\\nmaking her write things down. Perfect nonsense it was; about death;\\r\\nabout Miss Isabel Pole. She could stand it no longer. She would go\\r\\nback. She was close to him now, could see him staring at the sky,\\r\\nmuttering, clasping his hands. Yet Dr. Holmes said there was nothing\\r\\nthe matter with him. What then had happened--why had he gone, then,\\r\\nwhy, when she sat by him, did he start, frown at her, move away, and\\r\\npoint at her hand, take her hand, look at it terrified? Was it that she had taken off her wedding ring? \"My hand has grown\\r\\nso thin,\" she said. \"I have put it in my purse,\" she told him. He dropped her hand. Their marriage was over, he thought, with\\r\\nagony, with relief. The rope was cut; he mounted; he was free, as it\\r\\nwas decreed that he, Septimus, the lord of men, should be free; alone\\r\\n(since his wife had thrown away her wedding ring; since she had left\\r\\nhim), he, Septimus, was alone, called forth in advance of the mass of\\r\\nmen to hear the truth, to learn the meaning, which now at last, after\\r\\nall the toils of civilisation--Greeks, Romans, Shakespeare, Darwin,\\r\\nand now himself--was to be given whole to. . . . \"To whom?\" he asked\\r\\naloud. \"To the Prime Minister,\" the voices which rustled above his\\r\\nhead replied. The supreme secret must be told to the Cabinet; first\\r\\nthat trees are alive; next there is no crime; next love, universal\\r\\nlove, he muttered, gasping, trembling, painfully drawing out these\\r\\nprofound truths which needed, so deep were they, so difficult, an\\r\\nimmense effort to speak out, but the world was entirely changed by\\r\\nthem for ever. No crime; love; he repeated, fumbling for his card and pencil,\\r\\nwhen a Skye terrier snuffed his trousers and he started in an agony\\r\\nof fear. It was turning into a man! He could not watch it happen! It\\r\\nwas horrible, terrible to see a dog become a man! At once the dog\\r\\ntrotted away. Heaven was divinely merciful, infinitely benignant. It spared him,\\r\\npardoned his weakness. But what was the scientific explanation (for\\r\\none must be scientific above all things)? Why could he see through\\r\\nbodies, see into the future, when dogs will become men? It was the\\r\\nheat wave presumably, operating upon a brain made sensitive by eons\\r\\nof evolution. Scientifically speaking, the flesh was melted off the\\r\\nworld. His body was macerated until only the nerve fibres were left.\\r\\nIt was spread like a veil upon a rock. He lay back in his chair, exhausted but upheld. He lay resting,\\r\\nwaiting, before he again interpreted, with effort, with agony, to\\r\\nmankind. He lay very high, on the back of the world. The earth\\r\\nthrilled beneath him. Red flowers grew through his flesh; their stiff\\r\\nleaves rustled by his head. Music began clanging against the rocks up\\r\\nhere. It is a motor horn down in the street, he muttered; but up here\\r\\nit cannoned from rock to rock, divided, met in shocks of sound which\\r\\nrose in smooth columns (that music should be visible was a discovery)\\r\\nand became an anthem, an anthem twined round now by a shepherd boy\\'s\\r\\npiping (That\\'s an old man playing a penny whistle by the\\r\\npublic-house, he muttered) which, as the boy stood still came\\r\\nbubbling from his pipe, and then, as he climbed higher, made its\\r\\nexquisite plaint while the traffic passed beneath. This boy\\'s elegy\\r\\nis played among the traffic, thought Septimus. Now he withdraws up\\r\\ninto the snows, and roses hang about him--the thick red roses which\\r\\ngrow on my bedroom wall, he reminded himself. The music stopped. He\\r\\nhas his penny, he reasoned it out, and has gone on to the next\\r\\npublic-house. But he himself remained high on his rock, like a drowned sailor on\\r\\na rock. I leant over the edge of the boat and fell down, he thought.\\r\\nI went under the sea. I have been dead, and yet am now alive, but let\\r\\nme rest still; he begged (he was talking to himself again--it was\\r\\nawful, awful!); and as, before waking, the voices of birds and the\\r\\nsound of wheels chime and chatter in a queer harmony, grow louder and\\r\\nlouder and the sleeper feels himself drawing to the shores of life,\\r\\nso he felt himself drawing towards life, the sun growing hotter,\\r\\ncries sounding louder, something tremendous about to happen. He had only to open his eyes; but a weight was on them; a fear. He\\r\\nstrained; he pushed; he looked; he saw Regent\\'s Park before him. Long\\r\\nstreamers of sunlight fawned at his feet. The trees waved,\\r\\nbrandished. We welcome, the world seemed to say; we accept; we\\r\\ncreate. Beauty, the world seemed to say. And as if to prove it\\r\\n(scientifically) wherever he looked at the houses, at the railings,\\r\\nat the antelopes stretching over the palings, beauty sprang\\r\\ninstantly. To watch a leaf quivering in the rush of air was an\\r\\nexquisite joy. Up in the sky swallows swooping, swerving, flinging\\r\\nthemselves in and out, round and round, yet always with perfect\\r\\ncontrol as if elastics held them; and the flies rising and falling;\\r\\nand the sun spotting now this leaf, now that, in mockery, dazzling it\\r\\nwith soft gold in pure good temper; and now and again some chime (it\\r\\nmight be a motor horn) tinkling divinely on the grass stalks--all of\\r\\nthis, calm and reasonable as it was, made out of ordinary things as\\r\\nit was, was the truth now; beauty, that was the truth now. Beauty was\\r\\neverywhere. \"It is time,\" said Rezia. The word \"time\" split its husk; poured its riches over him; and\\r\\nfrom his lips fell like shells, like shavings from a plane, without\\r\\nhis making them, hard, white, imperishable words, and flew to attach\\r\\nthemselves to their places in an ode to Time; an immortal ode to\\r\\nTime. He sang. Evans answered from behind the tree. The dead were in\\r\\nThessaly, Evans sang, among the orchids. There they waited till the\\r\\nWar was over, and now the dead, now Evans himself-- \"For God\\'s sake don\\'t come!\" Septimus cried out. For he could not\\r\\nlook upon the dead. But the branches parted. A man in grey was actually walking\\r\\ntowards them. It was Evans! But no mud was on him; no wounds; he was\\r\\nnot changed. I must tell the whole world, Septimus cried, raising his\\r\\nhand (as the dead man in the grey suit came nearer), raising his hand\\r\\nlike some colossal figure who has lamented the fate of man for ages\\r\\nin the desert alone with his hands pressed to his forehead, furrows\\r\\nof despair on his cheeks, and now sees light on the desert\\'s edge\\r\\nwhich broadens and strikes the iron-black figure (and Septimus half\\r\\nrose from his chair), and with legions of men prostrate behind him\\r\\nhe, the giant mourner, receives for one moment on his face the\\r\\nwhole-- \"But I am so unhappy, Septimus,\" said Rezia trying to make him sit\\r\\ndown. The millions lamented; for ages they had sorrowed. He would turn\\r\\nround, he would tell them in a few moments, only a few moments more,\\r\\nof this relief, of this joy, of this astonishing revelation-- \"The time, Septimus,\" Rezia repeated. \"What is the time?\" He was talking, he was starting, this man must notice him. He was\\r\\nlooking at them. \"I will tell you the time,\" said Septimus, very slowly, very\\r\\ndrowsily, smiling mysteriously. As he sat smiling at the dead man in\\r\\nthe grey suit the quarter struck--the quarter to twelve. And that is being young, Peter Walsh thought as he passed them. To\\r\\nbe having an awful scene--the poor girl looked absolutely\\r\\ndesperate--in the middle of the morning. But what was it about, he\\r\\nwondered, what had the young man in the overcoat been saying to her\\r\\nto make her look like that; what awful fix had they got themselves\\r\\ninto, both to look so desperate as that on a fine summer morning? The\\r\\namusing thing about coming back to England, after five years, was the\\r\\nway it made, anyhow the first days, things stand out as if one had\\r\\nnever seen them before; lovers squabbling under a tree; the domestic\\r\\nfamily life of the parks. Never had he seen London look so\\r\\nenchanting--the softness of the distances; the richness; the\\r\\ngreenness; the civilisation, after India, he thought, strolling\\r\\nacross the grass. This susceptibility to impressions had been his undoing no doubt.\\r\\nStill at his age he had, like a boy or a girl even, these\\r\\nalternations of mood; good days, bad days, for no reason whatever,\\r\\nhappiness from a pretty face, downright misery at the sight of a\\r\\nfrump. After India of course one fell in love with every woman one\\r\\nmet. There was a freshness about them; even the poorest dressed\\r\\nbetter than five years ago surely; and to his eye the fashions had\\r\\nnever been so becoming; the long black cloaks; the slimness; the\\r\\nelegance; and then the delicious and apparently universal habit of\\r\\npaint. Every woman, even the most respectable, had roses blooming\\r\\nunder glass; lips cut with a knife; curls of Indian ink; there was\\r\\ndesign, art, everywhere; a change of some sort had undoubtedly taken\\r\\nplace. What did the young people think about? Peter Walsh asked\\r\\nhimself. Those five years--1918 to 1923--had been, he suspected, somehow\\r\\nvery important. People looked different. Newspapers seemed different.\\r\\nNow for instance there was a man writing quite openly in one of the\\r\\nrespectable weeklies about water-closets. That you couldn\\'t have done\\r\\nten years ago--written quite openly about water-closets in a\\r\\nrespectable weekly. And then this taking out a stick of rouge, or a\\r\\npowder-puff and making up in public. On board ship coming home there\\r\\nwere lots of young men and girls--Betty and Bertie he remembered in\\r\\nparticular--carrying on quite openly; the old mother sitting and\\r\\nwatching them with her knitting, cool as a cucumber. The girl would\\r\\nstand still and powder her nose in front of every one. And they\\r\\nweren\\'t engaged; just having a good time; no feelings hurt on either\\r\\nside. As hard as nails she was--Betty What\\'shername--; but a thorough\\r\\ngood sort. She would make a very good wife at thirty--she would marry\\r\\nwhen it suited her to marry; marry some rich man and live in a large\\r\\nhouse near Manchester. Who was it now who had done that? Peter Walsh asked himself,\\r\\nturning into the Broad Walk,--married a rich man and lived in a large\\r\\nhouse near Manchester? Somebody who had written him a long, gushing\\r\\nletter quite lately about \"blue hydrangeas.\" It was seeing blue\\r\\nhydrangeas that made her think of him and the old days--Sally Seton,\\r\\nof course! It was Sally Seton--the last person in the world one would\\r\\nhave expected to marry a rich man and live in a large house near\\r\\nManchester, the wild, the daring, the romantic Sally! But of all that ancient lot, Clarissa\\'s friends--Whitbreads,\\r\\nKinderleys, Cunninghams, Kinloch-Jones\\'s--Sally was probably the\\r\\nbest. She tried to get hold of things by the right end anyhow. She\\r\\nsaw through Hugh Whitbread anyhow--the admirable Hugh--when Clarissa\\r\\nand the rest were at his feet. \"The Whitbreads?\" he could hear her saying. \"Who are the\\r\\nWhitbreads? Coal merchants. Respectable tradespeople.\" Hugh she detested for some reason. He thought of nothing but his\\r\\nown appearance, she said. He ought to have been a Duke. He would be\\r\\ncertain to marry one of the Royal Princesses. And of course Hugh had\\r\\nthe most extraordinary, the most natural, the most sublime respect\\r\\nfor the British aristocracy of any human being he had ever come\\r\\nacross. Even Clarissa had to own that. Oh, but he was such a dear, so\\r\\nunselfish, gave up shooting to please his old mother--remembered his\\r\\naunts\\' birthdays, and so on. Sally, to do her justice, saw through all that. One of the things\\r\\nhe remembered best was an argument one Sunday morning at Bourton\\r\\nabout women\\'s rights (that antediluvian topic), when Sally suddenly\\r\\nlost her temper, flared up, and told Hugh that he represented all\\r\\nthat was most detestable in British middle-class life. She told him\\r\\nthat she considered him responsible for the state of \"those poor\\r\\ngirls in Piccadilly\"--Hugh, the perfect gentleman, poor Hugh!--never\\r\\ndid a man look more horrified! She did it on purpose she said\\r\\nafterwards (for they used to get together in the vegetable garden and\\r\\ncompare notes). \"He\\'s read nothing, thought nothing, felt nothing,\"\\r\\nhe could hear her saying in that very emphatic voice which carried so\\r\\nmuch farther than she knew. The stable boys had more life in them\\r\\nthan Hugh, she said. He was a perfect specimen of the public school\\r\\ntype, she said. No country but England could have produced him. She\\r\\nwas really spiteful, for some reason; had some grudge against him.\\r\\nSomething had happened--he forgot what--in the smoking-room. He had\\r\\ninsulted her--kissed her? Incredible! Nobody believed a word against\\r\\nHugh of course. Who could? Kissing Sally in the smoking-room! If it\\r\\nhad been some Honourable Edith or Lady Violet, perhaps; but not that\\r\\nragamuffin Sally without a penny to her name, and a father or a\\r\\nmother gambling at Monte Carlo. For of all the people he had ever met\\r\\nHugh was the greatest snob--the most obsequious--no, he didn\\'t cringe\\r\\nexactly. He was too much of a prig for that. A first-rate valet was\\r\\nthe obvious comparison--somebody who walked behind carrying suit\\r\\ncases; could be trusted to send telegrams--indispensable to\\r\\nhostesses. And he\\'d found his job--married his Honourable Evelyn; got\\r\\nsome little post at Court, looked after the King\\'s cellars, polished\\r\\nthe Imperial shoe-buckles, went about in knee-breeches and lace\\r\\nruffles. How remorseless life is! A little job at Court! He had married this lady, the Honourable Evelyn, and they lived\\r\\nhereabouts, so he thought (looking at the pompous houses overlooking\\r\\nthe Park), for he had lunched there once in a house which had, like\\r\\nall Hugh\\'s possessions, something that no other house could possibly\\r\\nhave--linen cupboards it might have been. You had to go and look at\\r\\nthem--you had to spend a great deal of time always admiring whatever\\r\\nit was--linen cupboards, pillow-cases, old oak furniture, pictures,\\r\\nwhich Hugh had picked up for an old song. But Mrs. Hugh sometimes\\r\\ngave the show away. She was one of those obscure mouse-like little\\r\\nwomen who admire big men. She was almost negligible. Then suddenly\\r\\nshe would say something quite unexpected--something sharp. She had\\r\\nthe relics of the grand manner perhaps. The steam coal was a little\\r\\ntoo strong for her--it made the atmosphere thick. And so there they\\r\\nlived, with their linen cupboards and their old masters and their\\r\\npillow-cases fringed with real lace at the rate of five or ten\\r\\nthousand a year presumably, while he, who was two years older than\\r\\nHugh, cadged for a job. At fifty-three he had to come and ask them to put him into some\\r\\nsecretary\\'s office, to find him some usher\\'s job teaching little boys\\r\\nLatin, at the beck and call of some mandarin in an office, something\\r\\nthat brought in five hundred a year; for if he married Daisy, even\\r\\nwith his pension, they could never do on less. Whitbread could do it\\r\\npresumably; or Dalloway. He didn\\'t mind what he asked Dalloway. He\\r\\nwas a thorough good sort; a bit limited; a bit thick in the head;\\r\\nyes; but a thorough good sort. Whatever he took up he did in the same\\r\\nmatter-of-fact sensible way; without a touch of imagination, without\\r\\na spark of brilliancy, but with the inexplicable niceness of his\\r\\ntype. He ought to have been a country gentleman--he was wasted on\\r\\npolitics. He was at his best out of doors, with horses and dogs--how\\r\\ngood he was, for instance, when that great shaggy dog of Clarissa\\'s\\r\\ngot caught in a trap and had its paw half torn off, and Clarissa\\r\\nturned faint and Dalloway did the whole thing; bandaged, made\\r\\nsplints; told Clarissa not to be a fool. That was what she liked him\\r\\nfor perhaps--that was what she needed. \"Now, my dear, don\\'t be a\\r\\nfool. Hold this--fetch that,\" all the time talking to the dog as if\\r\\nit were a human being. But how could she swallow all that stuff about poetry? How could\\r\\nshe let him hold forth about Shakespeare? Seriously and solemnly\\r\\nRichard Dalloway got on his hind legs and said that no decent man\\r\\nought to read Shakespeare\\'s sonnets because it was like listening at\\r\\nkeyholes (besides the relationship was not one that he approved). No\\r\\ndecent man ought to let his wife visit a deceased wife\\'s sister.\\r\\nIncredible! The only thing to do was to pelt him with sugared\\r\\nalmonds--it was at dinner. But Clarissa sucked it all in; thought it\\r\\nso honest of him; so independent of him; Heaven knows if she didn\\'t\\r\\nthink him the most original mind she\\'d ever met! That was one of the bonds between Sally and himself. There was a\\r\\ngarden where they used to walk, a walled-in place, with rose-bushes\\r\\nand giant cauliflowers--he could remember Sally tearing off a rose,\\r\\nstopping to exclaim at the beauty of the cabbage leaves in the\\r\\nmoonlight (it was extraordinary how vividly it all came back to him,\\r\\nthings he hadn\\'t thought of for years,) while she implored him, half\\r\\nlaughing of course, to carry off Clarissa, to save her from the Hughs\\r\\nand the Dalloways and all the other \"perfect gentlemen\" who would\\r\\n\"stifle her soul\" (she wrote reams of poetry in those days), make a\\r\\nmere hostess of her, encourage her worldliness. But one must do\\r\\nClarissa justice. She wasn\\'t going to marry Hugh anyhow. She had a\\r\\nperfectly clear notion of what she wanted. Her emotions were all on\\r\\nthe surface. Beneath, she was very shrewd--a far better judge of\\r\\ncharacter than Sally, for instance, and with it all, purely feminine;\\r\\nwith that extraordinary gift, that woman\\'s gift, of making a world of\\r\\nher own wherever she happened to be. She came into a room; she stood,\\r\\nas he had often seen her, in a doorway with lots of people round her.\\r\\nBut it was Clarissa one remembered. Not that she was striking; not\\r\\nbeautiful at all; there was nothing picturesque about her; she never\\r\\nsaid anything specially clever; there she was, however; there she\\r\\nwas. No, no, no! He was not in love with her any more! He only felt,\\r\\nafter seeing her that morning, among her scissors and silks, making\\r\\nready for the party, unable to get away from the thought of her; she\\r\\nkept coming back and back like a sleeper jolting against him in a\\r\\nrailway carriage; which was not being in love, of course; it was\\r\\nthinking of her, criticising her, starting again, after thirty years,\\r\\ntrying to explain her. The obvious thing to say of her was that she\\r\\nwas worldly; cared too much for rank and society and getting on in\\r\\nthe world--which was true in a sense; she had admitted it to him.\\r\\n(You could always get her to own up if you took the trouble; she was\\r\\nhonest.) What she would say was that she hated frumps, fogies,\\r\\nfailures, like himself presumably; thought people had no right to\\r\\nslouch about with their hands in their pockets; must do something, be\\r\\nsomething; and these great swells, these Duchesses, these hoary old\\r\\nCountesses one met in her drawing-room, unspeakably remote as he felt\\r\\nthem to be from anything that mattered a straw, stood for something\\r\\nreal to her. Lady Bexborough, she said once, held herself upright (so\\r\\ndid Clarissa herself; she never lounged in any sense of the word; she\\r\\nwas straight as a dart, a little rigid in fact). She said they had a\\r\\nkind of courage which the older she grew the more she respected. In\\r\\nall this there was a great deal of Dalloway, of course; a great deal\\r\\nof the public-spirited, British Empire, tariff-reform,\\r\\ngoverning-class spirit, which had grown on her, as it tends to do.\\r\\nWith twice his wits, she had to see things through his eyes--one of\\r\\nthe tragedies of married life. With a mind of her own, she must\\r\\nalways be quoting Richard--as if one couldn\\'t know to a tittle what\\r\\nRichard thought by reading the   of a morning!\\r\\nThese parties for example were all for him, or for her idea of him\\r\\n(to do Richard justice he would have been happier farming in\\r\\nNorfolk). She made her drawing-room a sort of meeting-place; she had\\r\\na genius for it. Over and over again he had seen her take some raw\\r\\nyouth, twist him, turn him, wake him up; set him going. Infinite\\r\\nnumbers of dull people conglomerated round her of course. But odd\\r\\nunexpected people turned up; an artist sometimes; sometimes a writer;\\r\\nqueer fish in that atmosphere. And behind it all was that network of\\r\\nvisiting, leaving cards, being kind to people; running about with\\r\\nbunches of flowers, little presents; So-and-so was going to\\r\\nFrance--must have an air-cushion; a real drain on her strength; all\\r\\nthat interminable traffic that women of her sort keep up; but she did\\r\\nit genuinely, from a natural instinct. Oddly enough, she was one of the most thoroughgoing sceptics he\\r\\nhad ever met, and possibly (this was a theory he used to make up to\\r\\naccount for her, so transparent in some ways, so inscrutable in\\r\\nothers), possibly she said to herself, As we are a doomed race,\\r\\nchained to a sinking ship (her favourite reading as a girl was Huxley\\r\\nand Tyndall, and they were fond of these nautical metaphors), as the\\r\\nwhole thing is a bad joke, let us, at any rate, do our part; mitigate\\r\\nthe sufferings of our fellow-prisoners (Huxley again); decorate the\\r\\ndungeon with flowers and air-cushions; be as decent as we possibly\\r\\ncan. Those ruffians, the Gods, shan\\'t have it all their own way,--her\\r\\nnotion being that the Gods, who never lost a chance of hurting,\\r\\nthwarting and spoiling human lives were seriously put out if, all the\\r\\nsame, you behaved like a lady. That phase came directly after\\r\\nSylvia\\'s death--that horrible affair. To see your own sister killed\\r\\nby a falling tree (all Justin Parry\\'s fault--all his carelessness)\\r\\nbefore your very eyes, a girl too on the verge of life, the most\\r\\ngifted of them, Clarissa always said, was enough to turn one bitter.\\r\\nLater she wasn\\'t so positive perhaps; she thought there were no Gods;\\r\\nno one was to blame; and so she evolved this atheist\\'s religion of\\r\\ndoing good for the sake of goodness. And of course she enjoyed life immensely. It was her nature to\\r\\nenjoy (though goodness only knows, she had her reserves; it was a\\r\\nmere sketch, he often felt, that even he, after all these years,\\r\\ncould make of Clarissa). Anyhow there was no bitterness in her; none\\r\\nof that sense of moral virtue which is so repulsive in good women.\\r\\nShe enjoyed practically everything. If you walked with her in Hyde\\r\\nPark now it was a bed of tulips, now a child in a perambulator, now\\r\\nsome absurd little drama she made up on the spur of the moment. (Very\\r\\nlikely, she would have talked to those lovers, if she had thought\\r\\nthem unhappy.) She had a sense of comedy that was really exquisite,\\r\\nbut she needed people, always people, to bring it out, with the\\r\\ninevitable result that she frittered her time away, lunching, dining,\\r\\ngiving these incessant parties of hers, talking nonsense, sayings\\r\\nthings she didn\\'t mean, blunting the edge of her mind, losing her\\r\\ndiscrimination. There she would sit at the head of the table taking\\r\\ninfinite pains with some old buffer who might be useful to\\r\\nDalloway--they knew the most appalling bores in Europe--or in came\\r\\nElizabeth and everything must give way to   She was at a\\r\\nHigh School, at the inarticulate stage last time he was over, a\\r\\nround-eyed, pale-faced girl, with nothing of her mother in her, a\\r\\nsilent stolid creature, who took it all as a matter of course, let\\r\\nher mother make a fuss of her, and then said \"May I go now?\" like a\\r\\nchild of four; going off, Clarissa explained, with that mixture of\\r\\namusement and pride which Dalloway himself seemed to rouse in her, to\\r\\nplay hockey. And now Elizabeth was \"out,\" presumably; thought him an\\r\\nold fogy, laughed at her mother\\'s friends. Ah well, so be it. The\\r\\ncompensation of growing old, Peter Walsh thought, coming out of\\r\\nRegent\\'s Park, and holding his hat in hand, was simply this; that the\\r\\npassions remain as strong as ever, but one has gained--at last!--the\\r\\npower which adds the supreme flavour to existence,--the power of\\r\\ntaking hold of experience, of turning it round, slowly, in the\\r\\nlight. A terrible confession it was (he put his hat on again), but now,\\r\\nat the age of fifty-three one scarcely needed people any more. Life\\r\\nitself, every moment of it, every drop of it, here, this instant,\\r\\nnow, in the sun, in Regent\\'s Park, was enough. Too much indeed. A\\r\\nwhole lifetime was too short to bring out, now that one had acquired\\r\\nthe power, the full flavour; to extract every ounce of pleasure,\\r\\nevery shade of meaning; which both were so much more solid than they\\r\\nused to be, so much less personal. It was impossible that he should\\r\\never suffer again as Clarissa had made him suffer. For hours at a\\r\\ntime (pray God that one might say these things without being\\r\\noverheard!), for hours and days he never thought of Daisy. Could it be that he was in love with her then, remembering the\\r\\nmisery, the torture, the extraordinary passion of those days? It was\\r\\na different thing altogether--a much pleasanter thing--the truth\\r\\nbeing, of course, that now   was in love with  \\r\\nAnd that perhaps was the reason why, when the ship actually sailed,\\r\\nhe felt an extraordinary relief, wanted nothing so much as to be\\r\\nalone; was annoyed to find all her little attentions--cigars, notes,\\r\\na rug for the voyage--in his cabin. Every one if they were honest\\r\\nwould say the same; one doesn\\'t want people after fifty; one doesn\\'t\\r\\nwant to go on telling women they are pretty; that\\'s what most men of\\r\\nfifty would say, Peter Walsh thought, if they were honest. But then these astonishing accesses of emotion--bursting into\\r\\ntears this morning, what was all that about? What could Clarissa have\\r\\nthought of him? thought him a fool presumably, not for the first\\r\\ntime. It was jealousy that was at the bottom of it--jealousy which\\r\\nsurvives every other passion of mankind, Peter Walsh thought, holding\\r\\nhis pocket-knife at arm\\'s length. She had been meeting Major Orde,\\r\\nDaisy said in her last letter; said it on purpose he knew; said it to\\r\\nmake him jealous; he could see her wrinkling her forehead as she\\r\\nwrote, wondering what she could say to hurt him; and yet it made no\\r\\ndifference; he was furious! All this pother of coming to England and\\r\\nseeing lawyers wasn\\'t to marry her, but to prevent her from marrying\\r\\nanybody else. That was what tortured him, that was what came over him\\r\\nwhen he saw Clarissa so calm, so cold, so intent on her dress or\\r\\nwhatever it was; realising what she might have spared him, what she\\r\\nhad reduced him to--a whimpering, snivelling old ass. But women, he\\r\\nthought, shutting his pocket-knife, don\\'t know what passion is. They\\r\\ndon\\'t know the meaning of it to men. Clarissa was as cold as an\\r\\nicicle. There she would sit on the sofa by his side, let him take her\\r\\nhand, give him one kiss--Here he was at the crossing. A sound interrupted him; a frail quivering sound, a voice bubbling\\r\\nup without direction, vigour, beginning or end, running weakly and\\r\\nshrilly and with an absence of all human meaning into \\xa0 ee um fah um so \\r\\n foo swee too eem oo-- \\xa0 the voice of no age or sex, the voice of an ancient spring\\r\\nspouting from the earth; which issued, just opposite Regent\\'s Park\\r\\nTube station from a tall quivering shape, like a funnel, like a rusty\\r\\npump, like a wind-beaten tree for ever barren of leaves which lets\\r\\nthe wind run up and down its branches singing \\xa0 ee um fah um so \\r\\n foo swee too eem oo \\xa0 and rocks and creaks and moans in the eternal breeze. Through all ages--when the pavement was grass, when it was swamp,\\r\\nthrough the age of tusk and mammoth, through the age of silent\\r\\nsunrise, the battered woman--for she wore a skirt--with her right\\r\\nhand exposed, her left clutching at her side, stood singing of\\r\\nlove--love which has lasted a million years, she sang, love which\\r\\nprevails, and millions of years ago, her lover, who had been dead\\r\\nthese centuries, had walked, she crooned, with her in May; but in the\\r\\ncourse of ages, long as summer days, and flaming, she remembered,\\r\\nwith nothing but red asters, he had gone; death\\'s enormous sickle had\\r\\nswept those tremendous hills, and when at last she laid her hoary and\\r\\nimmensely aged head on the earth, now become a mere cinder of ice,\\r\\nshe implored the Gods to lay by her side a bunch of purple-heather,\\r\\nthere on her high burial place which the last rays of the last sun\\r\\ncaressed; for then the pageant of the universe would be over. As the ancient song bubbled up opposite Regent\\'s Park Tube station\\r\\nstill the earth seemed green and flowery; still, though it issued\\r\\nfrom so rude a mouth, a mere hole in the earth, muddy too, matted\\r\\nwith root fibres and tangled grasses, still the old bubbling burbling\\r\\nsong, soaking through the knotted roots of infinite ages, and\\r\\nskeletons and treasure, streamed away in rivulets over the pavement\\r\\nand all along the Marylebone Road, and down towards Euston,\\r\\nfertilising, leaving a damp stain. Still remembering how once in some primeval May she had walked\\r\\nwith her lover, this rusty pump, this battered old woman with one\\r\\nhand exposed for coppers the other clutching her side, would still be\\r\\nthere in ten million years, remembering how once she had walked in\\r\\nMay, where the sea flows now, with whom it did not matter--he was a\\r\\nman, oh yes, a man who had loved her. But the passage of ages had\\r\\nblurred the clarity of that ancient May day; the bright petalled\\r\\nflowers were hoar and silver frosted; and she no longer saw, when she\\r\\nimplored him (as she did now quite clearly) \"look in my eyes with thy\\r\\nsweet eyes intently,\" she no longer saw brown eyes, black whiskers or\\r\\nsunburnt face but only a looming shape, a shadow shape, to which,\\r\\nwith the bird-like freshness of the very aged she still twittered\\r\\n\"give me your hand and let me press it gently\" (Peter Walsh couldn\\'t\\r\\nhelp giving the poor creature a coin as he stepped into his taxi),\\r\\n\"and if some one should see, what matter they?\" she demanded; and her\\r\\nfist clutched at her side, and she smiled, pocketing her shilling,\\r\\nand all peering inquisitive eyes seemed blotted out, and the passing\\r\\ngenerations--the pavement was crowded with bustling middle-class\\r\\npeople--vanished, like leaves, to be trodden under, to be soaked and\\r\\nsteeped and made mould of by that eternal spring-- \\xa0 ee um fah um so \\r\\n foo swee too eem oo \\xa0 \"Poor old woman,\" said Rezia Warren Smith, waiting to cross. Oh poor old wretch! Suppose it was a wet night? Suppose one\\'s father, or somebody who\\r\\nhad known one in better days had happened to pass, and saw one\\r\\nstanding there in the gutter? And where did she sleep at night? Cheerfully, almost gaily, the invincible thread of sound wound up\\r\\ninto the air like the smoke from a cottage chimney, winding up clean\\r\\nbeech trees and issuing in a tuft of blue smoke among the topmost\\r\\nleaves. \"And if some one should see, what matter they?\" Since she was so unhappy, for weeks and weeks now, Rezia had given\\r\\nmeanings to things that happened, almost felt sometimes that she must\\r\\nstop people in the street, if they looked good, kind people, just to\\r\\nsay to them \"I am unhappy\"; and this old woman singing in the street\\r\\n\"if some one should see, what matter they?\" made her suddenly quite\\r\\nsure that everything was going to be right. They were going to Sir\\r\\nWilliam Bradshaw; she thought his name sounded nice; he would cure\\r\\nSeptimus at once. And then there was a brewer\\'s cart, and the grey\\r\\nhorses had upright bristles of straw in their tails; there were\\r\\nnewspaper placards. It was a silly, silly dream, being unhappy. So they crossed, Mr. and Mrs. Septimus Warren Smith, and was\\r\\nthere, after all, anything to draw attention to them, anything to\\r\\nmake a passer-by suspect here is a young man who carries in him the\\r\\ngreatest message in the world, and is, moreover, the happiest man in\\r\\nthe world, and the most miserable? Perhaps they walked more slowly\\r\\nthan other people, and there was something hesitating, trailing, in\\r\\nthe man\\'s walk, but what more natural for a clerk, who has not been\\r\\nin the West End on a weekday at this hour for years, than to keep\\r\\nlooking at the sky, looking at this, that and the other, as if\\r\\nPortland Place were a room he had come into when the family are away,\\r\\nthe chandeliers being hung in holland bags, and the caretaker, as she\\r\\nlets in long shafts of dusty light upon deserted, queer-looking\\r\\narmchairs, lifting one corner of the long blinds, explains to the\\r\\nvisitors what a wonderful place it is; how wonderful, but at the same\\r\\ntime, he thinks, as he looks at chairs and tables, how strange. To look at, he might have been a clerk, but of the better sort;\\r\\nfor he wore brown boots; his hands were educated; so, too, his\\r\\nprofile--his angular, big-nosed, intelligent, sensitive profile; but\\r\\nnot his lips altogether, for they were loose; and his eyes (as eyes\\r\\ntend to be), eyes merely; hazel, large; so that he was, on the whole,\\r\\na border case, neither one thing nor the other, might end with a\\r\\nhouse at Purley and a motor car, or continue renting apartments in\\r\\nback streets all his life; one of those half-educated, self-educated\\r\\nmen whose education is all learnt from books borrowed from public\\r\\nlibraries, read in the evening after the day\\'s work, on the advice of\\r\\nwell-known authors consulted by letter. As for the other experiences, the solitary ones, which people go\\r\\nthrough alone, in their bedrooms, in their offices, walking the\\r\\nfields and the streets of London, he had them; had left home, a mere\\r\\nboy, because of his mother; she lied; because he came down to tea for\\r\\nthe fiftieth time with his hands unwashed; because he could see no\\r\\nfuture for a poet in Stroud; and so, making a confidant of his little\\r\\nsister, had gone to London leaving an absurd note behind him, such as\\r\\ngreat men have written, and the world has read later when the story\\r\\nof their struggles has become famous. London has swallowed up many millions of young men called Smith;\\r\\nthought nothing of fantastic Christian names like Septimus with which\\r\\ntheir parents have thought to distinguish them. Lodging off the\\r\\nEuston Road, there were experiences, again experiences, such as\\r\\nchange a face in two years from a pink innocent oval to a face lean,\\r\\ncontracted, hostile. But of all this what could the most observant of\\r\\nfriends have said except what a gardener says when he opens the\\r\\nconservatory door in the morning and finds a new blossom on his\\r\\nplant:--It has flowered; flowered from vanity, ambition, idealism,\\r\\npassion, loneliness, courage, laziness, the usual seeds, which all\\r\\nmuddled up (in a room off the Euston Road), made him shy, and\\r\\nstammering, made him anxious to improve himself, made him fall in\\r\\nlove with Miss Isabel Pole, lecturing in the Waterloo Road upon\\r\\nShakespeare. Was he not like Keats? she asked; and reflected how she might give\\r\\nhim a taste of   and the rest; lent him\\r\\nbooks; wrote him scraps of letters; and lit in him such a fire as\\r\\nburns only once in a lifetime, without heat, flickering a red gold\\r\\nflame infinitely ethereal and insubstantial over Miss Pole;   and the Waterloo Road. He thought her beautiful,\\r\\nbelieved her impeccably wise; dreamed of her, wrote poems to her,\\r\\nwhich, ignoring the subject, she corrected in red ink; he saw her,\\r\\none summer evening, walking in a green dress in a square. \"It has\\r\\nflowered,\" the gardener might have said, had he opened the door; had\\r\\nhe come in, that is to say, any night about this time, and found him\\r\\nwriting; found him tearing up his writing; found him finishing a\\r\\nmasterpiece at three o\\'clock in the morning and running out to pace\\r\\nthe streets, and visiting churches, and fasting one day, drinking\\r\\nanother, devouring Shakespeare, Darwin,   and Bernard Shaw. Something was up, Mr. Brewer knew; Mr. Brewer, managing clerk at\\r\\nSibleys and Arrowsmiths, auctioneers, valuers, land and estate\\r\\nagents; something was up, he thought, and, being paternal with his\\r\\nyoung men, and thinking very highly of Smith\\'s abilities, and\\r\\nprophesying that he would, in ten or fifteen years, succeed to the\\r\\nleather arm-chair in the inner room under the skylight with the\\r\\ndeed-boxes round him, \"if he keeps his health,\" said Mr. Brewer, and\\r\\nthat was the danger--he looked weakly; advised football, invited him\\r\\nto supper and was seeing his way to consider recommending a rise of\\r\\nsalary, when something happened which threw out many of Mr. Brewer\\'s\\r\\ncalculations, took away his ablest young fellows, and eventually, so\\r\\nprying and insidious were the fingers of the European War, smashed a\\r\\nplaster cast of Ceres, ploughed a hole in the geranium beds, and\\r\\nutterly ruined the cook\\'s nerves at Mr. Brewer\\'s establishment at\\r\\nMuswell Hill. Septimus was one of the first to volunteer. He went to France to\\r\\nsave an England which consisted almost entirely of Shakespeare\\'s\\r\\nplays and Miss Isabel Pole in a green dress walking in a square.\\r\\nThere in the trenches the change which Mr. Brewer desired when he\\r\\nadvised football was produced instantly; he developed manliness; he\\r\\nwas promoted; he drew the attention, indeed the affection of his\\r\\nofficer, Evans by name. It was a case of two dogs playing on a\\r\\nhearth-rug; one worrying a paper screw, snarling, snapping, giving a\\r\\npinch, now and then, at the old dog\\'s ear; the other lying somnolent,\\r\\nblinking at the fire, raising a paw, turning and growling\\r\\ngood-temperedly. They had to be together, share with each other,\\r\\nfight with each other, quarrel with each other. But when Evans (Rezia\\r\\nwho had only seen him once called him \"a quiet man,\" a sturdy\\r\\nred-haired man, undemonstrative in the company of women), when Evans\\r\\nwas killed, just before the Armistice, in Italy, Septimus, far from\\r\\nshowing any emotion or recognising that here was the end of a\\r\\nfriendship, congratulated himself upon feeling very little and very\\r\\nreasonably. The War had taught him. It was sublime. He had gone\\r\\nthrough the whole show, friendship, European War, death, had won\\r\\npromotion, was still under thirty and was bound to survive. He was\\r\\nright there. The last shells missed him. He watched them explode with\\r\\nindifference. When peace came he was in Milan, billeted in the house\\r\\nof an innkeeper with a courtyard, flowers in tubs, little tables in\\r\\nthe open, daughters making hats, and to Lucrezia, the younger\\r\\ndaughter, he became engaged one evening when the panic was on\\r\\nhim--that he could not feel. For now that it was all over, truce signed, and the dead buried,\\r\\nhe had, especially in the evening, these sudden thunder-claps of\\r\\nfear. He could not feel. As he opened the door of the room where the\\r\\nItalian girls sat making hats, he could see them; could hear them;\\r\\nthey were rubbing wires among coloured beads in saucers; they were\\r\\nturning buckram shapes this way and that; the table was all strewn\\r\\nwith feathers, spangles, silks, ribbons; scissors were rapping on the\\r\\ntable; but something failed him; he could not feel. Still, scissors\\r\\nrapping, girls laughing, hats being made protected him; he was\\r\\nassured of safety; he had a refuge. But he could not sit there all\\r\\nnight. There were moments of waking in the early morning. The bed was\\r\\nfalling; he was falling. Oh for the scissors and the lamplight and\\r\\nthe buckram shapes! He asked Lucrezia to marry him, the younger of\\r\\nthe two, the gay, the frivolous, with those little artist\\'s fingers\\r\\nthat she would hold up and say \"It is all in them.\" Silk, feathers,\\r\\nwhat not were alive to them. \"It is the hat that matters most,\" she would say, when they walked\\r\\nout together. Every hat that passed, she would examine; and the cloak\\r\\nand the dress and the way the woman held herself. Ill-dressing,\\r\\nover-dressing she stigmatised, not savagely, rather with impatient\\r\\nmovements of the hands, like those of a painter who puts from him\\r\\nsome obvious well-meant glaring imposture; and then, generously, but\\r\\nalways critically, she would welcome a shopgirl who had turned her\\r\\nlittle bit of stuff gallantly, or praise, wholly, with enthusiastic\\r\\nand professional understanding, a French lady descending from her\\r\\ncarriage, in chinchilla, robes, pearls. \"Beautiful!\" she would murmur, nudging Septimus, that he might\\r\\nsee. But beauty was behind a pane of glass. Even taste (Rezia liked\\r\\nices, chocolates, sweet things) had no relish to him. He put down his\\r\\ncup on the little marble table. He looked at people outside; happy\\r\\nthey seemed, collecting in the middle of the street, shouting,\\r\\nlaughing, squabbling over nothing. But he could not taste, he could\\r\\nnot feel. In the tea-shop among the tables and the chattering waiters\\r\\nthe appalling fear came over him--he could not feel. He could reason;\\r\\nhe could read, Dante for example, quite easily (\"Septimus, do put\\r\\ndown your book,\" said Rezia, gently shutting the   he\\r\\ncould add up his bill; his brain was perfect; it must be the fault of\\r\\nthe world then--that he could not feel. \"The English are so silent,\" Rezia said. She liked it, she said.\\r\\nShe respected these Englishmen, and wanted to see London, and the\\r\\nEnglish horses, and the tailor-made suits, and could remember hearing\\r\\nhow wonderful the shops were, from an Aunt who had married and lived\\r\\nin Soho. It might be possible, Septimus thought, looking at England from\\r\\nthe train window, as they left Newhaven; it might be possible that\\r\\nthe world itself is without meaning. At the office they advanced him to a post of considerable\\r\\nresponsibility. They were proud of him; he had won crosses. \"You have\\r\\ndone your duty; it is up to us--\" began Mr. Brewer; and could not\\r\\nfinish, so pleasurable was his emotion. They took admirable lodgings\\r\\noff the Tottenham Court Road. Here he opened Shakespeare once more. That boy\\'s business of the\\r\\nintoxication of language-- --had shrivelled\\r\\nutterly. How Shakespeare loathed humanity--the putting on of clothes,\\r\\nthe getting of children, the sordidity of the mouth and the belly!\\r\\nThis was now revealed to Septimus; the message hidden in the beauty\\r\\nof words. The secret signal which one generation passes, under\\r\\ndisguise, to the next is loathing, hatred, despair. Dante the same.\\r\\nAeschylus (translated) the same. There Rezia sat at the table\\r\\ntrimming hats. She trimmed hats for Mrs. Filmer\\'s friends; she\\r\\ntrimmed hats by the hour. She looked pale, mysterious, like a lily,\\r\\ndrowned, under water, he thought. \"The English are so serious,\" she would say, putting her arms\\r\\nround Septimus, her cheek against his. Love between man and woman was repulsive to Shakespeare. The\\r\\nbusiness of copulation was filth to him before the end. But, Rezia\\r\\nsaid, she must have children. They had been married five years. They went to the Tower together; to the Victoria and Albert\\r\\nMuseum; stood in the crowd to see the King open Parliament. And there\\r\\nwere the shops--hat shops, dress shops, shops with leather bags in\\r\\nthe window, where she would stand staring. But she must have a\\r\\nboy. She must have a son like Septimus, she said. But nobody could be\\r\\nlike Septimus; so gentle; so serious; so clever. Could she not read\\r\\nShakespeare too? Was Shakespeare a difficult author? she asked. One cannot bring children into a world like this. One cannot\\r\\nperpetuate suffering, or increase the breed of these lustful animals,\\r\\nwho have no lasting emotions, but only whims and vanities, eddying\\r\\nthem now this way, now that. He watched her snip, shape, as one watches a bird hop, flit in the\\r\\ngrass, without daring to move a finger. For the truth is (let her\\r\\nignore it) that human beings have neither kindness, nor faith, nor\\r\\ncharity beyond what serves to increase the pleasure of the moment.\\r\\nThey hunt in packs. Their packs scour the desert and vanish screaming\\r\\ninto the wilderness. They desert the fallen. They are plastered over\\r\\nwith grimaces. There was Brewer at the office, with his waxed\\r\\nmoustache, coral tie-pin, white slip, and pleasurable emotions--all\\r\\ncoldness and clamminess within,--his geraniums ruined in the War--his\\r\\ncook\\'s nerves destroyed; or Amelia What\\'shername, handing round cups\\r\\nof tea punctually at five--a leering, sneering obscene little harpy;\\r\\nand the Toms and Berties in their starched shirt fronts oozing thick\\r\\ndrops of vice. They never saw him drawing pictures of them naked at\\r\\ntheir antics in his notebook. In the street, vans roared past him;\\r\\nbrutality blared out on placards; men were trapped in mines; women\\r\\nburnt alive; and once a maimed file of lunatics being exercised or\\r\\ndisplayed for the diversion of the populace (who laughed aloud),\\r\\nambled and nodded and grinned past him, in the Tottenham Court Road,\\r\\neach half apologetically, yet triumphantly, inflicting his hopeless\\r\\nwoe. And would   go mad? At tea Rezia told him that Mrs. Filmer\\'s daughter was expecting a\\r\\nbaby.   could not grow old and have no children! She was\\r\\nvery lonely, she was very unhappy! She cried for the first time since\\r\\nthey were married. Far away he heard her sobbing; he heard it\\r\\naccurately, he noticed it distinctly; he compared it to a piston\\r\\nthumping. But he felt nothing. His wife was crying, and he felt nothing; only each time she\\r\\nsobbed in this profound, this silent, this hopeless way, he descended\\r\\nanother step into the pit. At last, with a melodramatic gesture which he assumed mechanically\\r\\nand with complete consciousness of its insincerity, he dropped his\\r\\nhead on his hands. Now he had surrendered; now other people must help\\r\\nhim. People must be sent for. He gave in. Nothing could rouse him. Rezia put him to bed. She sent for a\\r\\ndoctor--Mrs. Filmer\\'s Dr. Holmes. Dr. Holmes examined him. There was\\r\\nnothing whatever the matter, said Dr. Holmes. Oh, what a relief! What\\r\\na kind man, what a good man! thought Rezia. When he felt like that he\\r\\nwent to the Music Hall, said Dr. Holmes. He took a day off with his\\r\\nwife and played golf. Why not try two tabloids of bromide dissolved\\r\\nin a glass of water at bedtime? These old Bloomsbury houses, said Dr.\\r\\nHolmes, tapping the wall, are often full of very fine panelling,\\r\\nwhich the landlords have the folly to paper over. Only the other day,\\r\\nvisiting a patient, Sir Somebody Something in Bedford Square-- So there was no excuse; nothing whatever the matter, except the\\r\\nsin for which human nature had condemned him to death; that he did\\r\\nnot feel. He had not cared when Evans was killed; that was worst; but\\r\\nall the other crimes raised their heads and shook their fingers and\\r\\njeered and sneered over the rail of the bed in the early hours of the\\r\\nmorning at the prostrate body which lay realising its degradation;\\r\\nhow he had married his wife without loving her; had lied to her;\\r\\nseduced her; outraged Miss Isabel Pole, and was so pocked and marked\\r\\nwith vice that women shuddered when they saw him in the street. The\\r\\nverdict of human nature on such a wretch was death. Dr. Holmes came again. Large, fresh coloured, handsome, flicking\\r\\nhis boots, looking in the glass, he brushed it all aside--headaches,\\r\\nsleeplessness, fears, dreams--nerve symptoms and nothing more, he\\r\\nsaid. If Dr. Holmes found himself even half a pound below eleven\\r\\nstone six, he asked his wife for another plate of porridge at\\r\\nbreakfast. (Rezia would learn to cook porridge.) But, he continued,\\r\\nhealth is largely a matter in our own control. Throw yourself into\\r\\noutside interests; take up some hobby. He opened\\r\\nShakespeare--  pushed Shakespeare aside.\\r\\nSome hobby, said Dr. Holmes, for did he not owe his own excellent\\r\\nhealth (and he worked as hard as any man in London) to the fact that\\r\\nhe could always switch off from his patients on to old furniture? And\\r\\nwhat a very pretty comb, if he might say so, Mrs. Warren Smith was\\r\\nwearing! When the damned fool came again, Septimus refused to see him. Did\\r\\nhe indeed? said Dr. Holmes, smiling agreeably. Really he had to give\\r\\nthat charming little lady, Mrs. Smith, a friendly push before he\\r\\ncould get past her into her husband\\'s bedroom. \"So you\\'re in a funk,\" he said agreeably, sitting down by his\\r\\npatient\\'s side. He had actually talked of killing himself to his\\r\\nwife, quite a girl, a foreigner, wasn\\'t she? Didn\\'t that give her a\\r\\nvery odd idea of English husbands? Didn\\'t one owe perhaps a duty to\\r\\none\\'s wife? Wouldn\\'t it be better to do something instead of lying in\\r\\nbed? For he had had forty years\\' experience behind him; and Septimus\\r\\ncould take Dr. Holmes\\'s word for it--there was nothing whatever the\\r\\nmatter with him. And next time Dr. Holmes came he hoped to find Smith\\r\\nout of bed and not making that charming little lady his wife anxious\\r\\nabout him. Human nature, in short, was on him--the repulsive brute, with the\\r\\nblood-red nostrils. Holmes was on him. Dr. Holmes came quite\\r\\nregularly every day. Once you stumble, Septimus wrote on the back of\\r\\na postcard, human nature is on you. Holmes is on you. Their only\\r\\nchance was to escape, without letting Holmes know; to\\r\\nItaly--anywhere, anywhere, away from Dr. Holmes. But Rezia could not understand him. Dr. Holmes was such a kind\\r\\nman. He was so interested in Septimus. He only wanted to help them,\\r\\nhe said. He had four little children and he had asked her to tea, she\\r\\ntold Septimus. So he was deserted. The whole world was clamouring: Kill yourself,\\r\\nkill yourself, for our sakes. But why should he kill himself for\\r\\ntheir sakes? Food was pleasant; the sun hot; and this killing\\r\\noneself, how does one set about it, with a table knife, uglily, with\\r\\nfloods of blood,--by sucking a gaspipe? He was too weak; he could\\r\\nscarcely raise his hand. Besides, now that he was quite alone,\\r\\ncondemned, deserted, as those who are about to die are alone, there\\r\\nwas a luxury in it, an isolation full of sublimity; a freedom which\\r\\nthe attached can never know. Holmes had won of course; the brute with\\r\\nthe red nostrils had won. But even Holmes himself could not touch\\r\\nthis last relic straying on the edge of the world, this outcast, who\\r\\ngazed back at the inhabited regions, who lay, like a drowned sailor,\\r\\non the shore of the world. It was at that moment (Rezia gone shopping) that the great\\r\\nrevelation took place. A voice spoke from behind the screen. Evans\\r\\nwas speaking. The dead were with him. \"Evans, Evans!\" he cried. Mr. Smith was talking aloud to himself, Agnes the servant girl\\r\\ncried to Mrs. Filmer in the kitchen. \"Evans, Evans,\" he had said as\\r\\nshe brought in the tray. She jumped, she did. She scuttled\\r\\ndownstairs. And Rezia came in, with her flowers, and walked across the room,\\r\\nand put the roses in a vase, upon which the sun struck directly, and\\r\\nit went laughing, leaping round the room. She had had to buy the roses, Rezia said, from a poor man in the\\r\\nstreet. But they were almost dead already, she said, arranging the\\r\\nroses. So there was a man outside; Evans presumably; and the roses, which\\r\\nRezia said were half dead, had been picked by him in the fields of\\r\\nGreece. \"Communication is health; communication is happiness,\\r\\ncommunication--\" he muttered. \"What are you saying, Septimus?\" Rezia asked, wild with terror,\\r\\nfor he was talking to himself. She sent Agnes running for Dr. Holmes. Her husband, she said, was\\r\\nmad. He scarcely knew her. \"You brute! You brute!\" cried Septimus, seeing human nature, that\\r\\nis Dr. Holmes, enter the room. \"Now what\\'s all this about?\" said Dr. Holmes in the most amiable\\r\\nway in the world. \"Talking nonsense to frighten your wife?\" But he\\r\\nwould give him something to make him sleep. And if they were rich\\r\\npeople, said Dr. Holmes, looking ironically round the room, by all\\r\\nmeans let them go to Harley Street; if they had no confidence in him,\\r\\nsaid Dr. Holmes, looking not quite so kind. It was precisely twelve o\\'clock; twelve by Big Ben; whose stroke\\r\\nwas wafted over the northern part of London; blent with that of other\\r\\nclocks, mixed in a thin ethereal way with the clouds and wisps of\\r\\nsmoke, and died up there among the seagulls--twelve o\\'clock struck as\\r\\nClarissa Dalloway laid her green dress on her bed, and the Warren\\r\\nSmiths walked down Harley Street. Twelve was the hour of their\\r\\nappointment. Probably, Rezia thought, that was Sir William Bradshaw\\'s\\r\\nhouse with the grey motor car in front of it. The leaden circles\\r\\ndissolved in the air. Indeed it was--Sir William Bradshaw\\'s motor car; low, powerful,\\r\\ngrey with plain initials\\' interlocked on the panel, as if the pomps\\r\\nof heraldry were incongruous, this man being the ghostly helper, the\\r\\npriest of science; and, as the motor car was grey, so to match its\\r\\nsober suavity, grey furs, silver grey rugs were heaped in it, to keep\\r\\nher ladyship warm while she waited. For often Sir William would\\r\\ntravel sixty miles or more down into the country to visit the rich,\\r\\nthe afflicted, who could afford the very large fee which Sir William\\r\\nvery properly charged for his advice. Her ladyship waited with the\\r\\nrugs about her knees an hour or more, leaning back, thinking\\r\\nsometimes of the patient, sometimes, excusably, of the wall of gold,\\r\\nmounting minute by minute while she waited; the wall of gold that was\\r\\nmounting between them and all shifts and anxieties (she had borne\\r\\nthem bravely; they had had their struggles) until she felt wedged on\\r\\na calm ocean, where only spice winds blow; respected, admired,\\r\\nenvied, with scarcely anything left to wish for, though she regretted\\r\\nher stoutness; large dinner-parties every Thursday night to the\\r\\nprofession; an occasional bazaar to be opened; Royalty greeted; too\\r\\nlittle time, alas, with her husband, whose work grew and grew; a boy\\r\\ndoing well at Eton; she would have liked a daughter too; interests\\r\\nshe had, however, in plenty; child welfare; the after-care of the\\r\\nepileptic, and photography, so that if there was a church building,\\r\\nor a church decaying, she bribed the sexton, got the key and took\\r\\nphotographs, which were scarcely to be distinguished from the work of\\r\\nprofessionals, while she waited. Sir William himself was no longer young. He had worked very hard;\\r\\nhe had won his position by sheer ability (being the son of a\\r\\nshopkeeper); loved his profession; made a fine figurehead at\\r\\nceremonies and spoke well--all of which had by the time he was\\r\\nknighted given him a heavy look, a weary look (the stream of patients\\r\\nbeing so incessant, the responsibilities and privileges of his\\r\\nprofession so onerous), which weariness, together with his grey\\r\\nhairs, increased the extraordinary distinction of his presence and\\r\\ngave him the reputation (of the utmost importance in dealing with\\r\\nnerve cases) not merely of lightning skill, and almost infallible\\r\\naccuracy in diagnosis but of sympathy; tact; understanding of the\\r\\nhuman soul. He could see the first moment they came into the room\\r\\n(the Warren Smiths they were called); he was certain directly he saw\\r\\nthe man; it was a case of extreme gravity. It was a case of complete\\r\\nbreakdown--complete physical and nervous breakdown, with every\\r\\nsymptom in an advanced stage, he ascertained in two or three minutes\\r\\n(writing answers to questions, murmured discreetly, on a pink\\r\\ncard). How long had Dr. Holmes been attending him? Six weeks. Prescribed a little bromide? Said there was nothing the matter? Ah\\r\\nyes (those general practitioners! thought Sir William. It took half\\r\\nhis time to undo their blunders. Some were irreparable). \"You served with great distinction in the War?\" The patient repeated the word \"war\" interrogatively. He was attaching meanings to words of a symbolical kind. A serious\\r\\nsymptom, to be noted on the card. \"The War?\" the patient asked. The European War--that little shindy\\r\\nof schoolboys with gunpowder? Had he served with distinction? He\\r\\nreally forgot. In the War itself he had failed. \"Yes, he served with the greatest distinction,\" Rezia assured the\\r\\ndoctor; \"he was promoted.\" \"And they have the very highest opinion of you at your office?\"\\r\\nSir William murmured, glancing at Mr. Brewer\\'s very generously worded\\r\\nletter. \"So that you have nothing to worry you, no financial anxiety,\\r\\nnothing?\" He had committed an appalling crime and been condemned to death by\\r\\nhuman nature. \"I have--I have,\" he began, \"committed a crime--\" \"He has done nothing wrong whatever,\" Rezia assured the doctor. If\\r\\nMr. Smith would wait, said Sir William, he would speak to Mrs. Smith\\r\\nin the next room. Her husband was very seriously ill, Sir William\\r\\nsaid. Did he threaten to kill himself? Oh, he did, she cried. But he did not mean it, she said. Of course\\r\\nnot. It was merely a question of rest, said Sir William; of rest,\\r\\nrest, rest; a long rest in bed. There was a delightful home down in\\r\\nthe country where her husband would be perfectly looked after. Away\\r\\nfrom her? she asked. Unfortunately, yes; the people we care for most\\r\\nare not good for us when we are ill. But he was not mad, was he? Sir\\r\\nWilliam said he never spoke of \"madness\"; he called it not having a\\r\\nsense of proportion. But her husband did not like doctors. He would\\r\\nrefuse to go there. Shortly and kindly Sir William explained to her\\r\\nthe state of the case. He had threatened to kill himself. There was\\r\\nno alternative. It was a question of law. He would lie in bed in a\\r\\nbeautiful house in the country. The nurses were admirable. Sir\\r\\nWilliam would visit him once a week. If Mrs. Warren Smith was quite\\r\\nsure she had no more questions to ask--he never hurried his\\r\\npatients--they would return to her husband. She had nothing more to\\r\\nask--not of Sir William. So they returned to the most exalted of mankind; the criminal who\\r\\nfaced his judges; the victim exposed on the heights; the fugitive;\\r\\nthe drowned sailor; the poet of the immortal ode; the Lord who had\\r\\ngone from life to death; to Septimus Warren Smith, who sat in the\\r\\narm-chair under the skylight staring at a photograph of Lady Bradshaw\\r\\nin Court dress, muttering messages about beauty. \"We have had our little talk,\" said Sir William. \"He says you are very, very ill,\" Rezia cried. \"We have been arranging that you should go into a home,\" said Sir\\r\\nWilliam. \"One of Holmes\\'s homes?\" sneered Septimus. The fellow made a distasteful impression. For there was in Sir\\r\\nWilliam, whose father had been a tradesman, a natural respect for\\r\\nbreeding and clothing, which shabbiness nettled; again, more\\r\\nprofoundly, there was in Sir William, who had never had time for\\r\\nreading, a grudge, deeply buried, against cultivated people who came\\r\\ninto his room and intimated that doctors, whose profession is a\\r\\nconstant strain upon all the highest faculties, are not educated\\r\\nmen. \"One of   homes, Mr. Warren Smith,\" he said, \"where we\\r\\nwill teach you to rest.\" And there was just one thing more. He was quite certain that when Mr. Warren Smith was well he was\\r\\nthe last man in the world to frighten his wife. But he had talked of\\r\\nkilling himself. \"We all have our moments of depression,\" said Sir William. Once you fall, Septimus repeated to himself, human nature is on\\r\\nyou. Holmes and Bradshaw are on you. They scour the desert. They fly\\r\\nscreaming into the wilderness. The rack and the thumbscrew are\\r\\napplied. Human nature is remorseless. \"Impulses came upon him sometimes?\" Sir William asked, with his\\r\\npencil on a pink card. That was his own affair, said Septimus. \"Nobody lives for himself alone,\" said Sir William, glancing at\\r\\nthe photograph of his wife in Court dress. \"And you have a brilliant career before you,\" said Sir William.\\r\\nThere was Mr. Brewer\\'s letter on the table. \"An exceptionally\\r\\nbrilliant career.\" But if he confessed? If he communicated? Would they let him off\\r\\nthen, his torturers? \"I--I--\" he stammered. But what was his crime? He could not remember it. \"Yes?\" Sir William encouraged him. (But it was growing late.) Love, trees, there is no crime--what was his message? He could not remember it. \"I--I--\" Septimus stammered. \"Try to think as little about yourself as possible,\" said Sir\\r\\nWilliam kindly. Really, he was not fit to be about. Was there anything else they wished to ask him? Sir William would\\r\\nmake all arrangements (he murmured to Rezia) and he would let her\\r\\nknow between five and six that evening he murmured. \"Trust everything to me,\" he said, and dismissed them. Never, never had Rezia felt such agony in her life! She had asked\\r\\nfor help and been deserted! He had failed them! Sir William Bradshaw\\r\\nwas not a nice man. The upkeep of that motor car alone must cost him quite a lot, said\\r\\nSeptimus, when they got out into the street. She clung to his arm. They had been deserted. But what more did she want? To his patients he gave three-quarters of an hour; and if in this\\r\\nexacting science which has to do with what, after all, we know\\r\\nnothing about--the nervous system, the human brain--a doctor loses\\r\\nhis sense of proportion, as a doctor he fails. Health we must have;\\r\\nand health is proportion; so that when a man comes into your room and\\r\\nsays he is Christ (a common delusion), and has a message, as they\\r\\nmostly have, and threatens, as they often do, to kill himself, you\\r\\ninvoke proportion; order rest in bed; rest in solitude; silence and\\r\\nrest; rest without friends, without books, without messages; six\\r\\nmonths\\' rest; until a man who went in weighing seven stone six comes\\r\\nout weighing twelve. Proportion, divine proportion, Sir William\\'s goddess, was acquired\\r\\nby Sir William walking hospitals, catching salmon, begetting one son\\r\\nin Harley Street by Lady Bradshaw, who caught salmon herself and took\\r\\nphotographs scarcely to be distinguished from the work of\\r\\nprofessionals. Worshipping proportion, Sir William not only prospered\\r\\nhimself but made England prosper, secluded her lunatics, forbade\\r\\nchildbirth, penalised despair, made it impossible for the unfit to\\r\\npropagate their views until they, too, shared his sense of\\r\\nproportion--his, if they were men, Lady Bradshaw\\'s if they were women\\r\\n(she embroidered, knitted, spent four nights out of seven at home\\r\\nwith her son), so that not only did his colleagues respect him, his\\r\\nsubordinates fear him, but the friends and relations of his patients\\r\\nfelt for him the keenest gratitude for insisting that these prophetic\\r\\nChrists and Christesses, who prophesied the end of the world, or the\\r\\nadvent of God, should drink milk in bed, as Sir William ordered; Sir\\r\\nWilliam with his thirty years\\' experience of these kinds of cases,\\r\\nand his infallible instinct, this is madness, this sense; in fact,\\r\\nhis sense of proportion. But Proportion has a sister, less smiling, more formidable, a\\r\\nGoddess even now engaged--in the heat and sands of India, the mud and\\r\\nswamp of Africa, the purlieus of London, wherever in short the\\r\\nclimate or the devil tempts men to fall from the true belief which is\\r\\nher own--is even now engaged in dashing down shrines, smashing idols,\\r\\nand setting up in their place her own stern countenance. Conversion\\r\\nis her name and she feasts on the wills of the weakly, loving to\\r\\nimpress, to impose, adoring her own features stamped on the face of\\r\\nthe populace. At Hyde Park Corner on a tub she stands preaching;\\r\\nshrouds herself in white and walks penitentially disguised as\\r\\nbrotherly love through factories and parliaments; offers help, but\\r\\ndesires power; smites out of her way roughly the dissentient, or\\r\\ndissatisfied; bestows her blessing on those who, looking upward,\\r\\ncatch submissively from her eyes the light of their own. This lady\\r\\ntoo (Rezia Warren Smith divined it) had her dwelling in Sir William\\'s\\r\\nheart, though concealed, as she mostly is, under some plausible\\r\\ndisguise; some venerable name; love, duty, self sacrifice. How he\\r\\nwould work--how toil to raise funds, propagate reforms, initiate\\r\\ninstitutions! But conversion, fastidious Goddess, loves blood better\\r\\nthan brick, and feasts most subtly on the human will. For example,\\r\\nLady Bradshaw. Fifteen years ago she had gone under. It was nothing\\r\\nyou could put your finger on; there had been no scene, no snap; only\\r\\nthe slow sinking, water-logged, of her will into his. Sweet was her\\r\\nsmile, swift her submission; dinner in Harley Street, numbering eight\\r\\nor nine courses, feeding ten or fifteen guests of the professional\\r\\nclasses, was smooth and urbane. Only as the evening wore on a very\\r\\nslight dulness, or uneasiness perhaps, a nervous twitch, fumble,\\r\\nstumble and confusion indicated, what it was really painful to\\r\\nbelieve--that the poor lady lied. Once, long ago, she had caught\\r\\nsalmon freely: now, quick to minister to the craving which lit her\\r\\nhusband\\'s eye so oilily for dominion, for power, she cramped,\\r\\nsqueezed, pared, pruned, drew back, peeped through; so that without\\r\\nknowing precisely what made the evening disagreeable, and caused this\\r\\npressure on the top of the head (which might well be imputed to the\\r\\nprofessional conversation, or the fatigue of a great doctor whose\\r\\nlife, Lady Bradshaw said, \"is not his own but his patients\\'\")\\r\\ndisagreeable it was: so that guests, when the clock struck ten,\\r\\nbreathed in the air of Harley Street even with rapture; which relief,\\r\\nhowever, was denied to his patients. There in the grey room, with the pictures on the wall, and the\\r\\nvaluable furniture, under the ground glass skylight, they learnt the\\r\\nextent of their transgressions; huddled up in arm-chairs, they\\r\\nwatched him go through, for their benefit, a curious exercise with\\r\\nthe arms, which he shot out, brought sharply back to his hip, to\\r\\nprove (if the patient was obstinate) that Sir William was master of\\r\\nhis own actions, which the patient was not. There some weakly broke\\r\\ndown; sobbed, submitted; others, inspired by Heaven knows what\\r\\nintemperate madness, called Sir William to his face a damnable\\r\\nhumbug; questioned, even more impiously, life itself. Why live? they\\r\\ndemanded. Sir William replied that life was good. Certainly Lady\\r\\nBradshaw in ostrich feathers hung over the mantelpiece, and as for\\r\\nhis income it was quite twelve thousand a year. But to us, they\\r\\nprotested, life has given no such bounty. He acquiesced. They lacked\\r\\na sense of proportion. And perhaps, after all, there is no God? He\\r\\nshrugged his shoulders. In short, this living or not living is an\\r\\naffair of our own? But there they were mistaken. Sir William had a\\r\\nfriend in Surrey where they taught, what Sir William frankly admitted\\r\\nwas a difficult art--a sense of proportion. There were, moreover,\\r\\nfamily affection; honour; courage; and a brilliant career. All of\\r\\nthese had in Sir William a resolute champion. If they failed him, he\\r\\nhad to support police and the good of society, which, he remarked\\r\\nvery quietly, would take care, down in Surrey, that these unsocial\\r\\nimpulses, bred more than anything by the lack of good blood, were\\r\\nheld in control. And then stole out from her hiding-place and mounted\\r\\nher throne that Goddess whose lust is to override opposition, to\\r\\nstamp indelibly in the sanctuaries of others the image of herself.\\r\\nNaked, defenceless, the exhausted, the friendless received the\\r\\nimpress of Sir William\\'s will. He swooped; he devoured. He shut\\r\\npeople up. It was this combination of decision and humanity that\\r\\nendeared Sir William so greatly to the relations of his victims. But Rezia Warren Smith cried, walking down Harley Street, that she\\r\\ndid not like that man. Shredding and slicing, dividing and subdividing, the clocks of\\r\\nHarley Street nibbled at the June day, counselled submission, upheld\\r\\nauthority, and pointed out in chorus the supreme advantages of a\\r\\nsense of proportion, until the mound of time was so far diminished\\r\\nthat a commercial clock, suspended above a shop in Oxford Street,\\r\\nannounced, genially and fraternally, as if it were a pleasure to\\r\\nMessrs. Rigby and Lowndes to give the information gratis, that it was\\r\\nhalf-past one. Looking up, it appeared that each letter of their names stood for\\r\\none of the hours; subconsciously one was grateful to Rigby and\\r\\nLowndes for giving one time ratified by Greenwich; and this gratitude\\r\\n(so Hugh Whitbread ruminated, dallying there in front of the shop\\r\\nwindow), naturally took the form later of buying off Rigby and\\r\\nLowndes socks or shoes. So he ruminated. It was his habit. He did not\\r\\ngo deeply. He brushed surfaces; the dead languages, the living, life\\r\\nin Constantinople, Paris, Rome; riding, shooting, tennis, it had been\\r\\nonce. The malicious asserted that he now kept guard at Buckingham\\r\\nPalace, dressed in silk stockings and knee-breeches, over what nobody\\r\\nknew. But he did it extremely efficiently. He had been afloat on the\\r\\ncream of English society for fifty-five years. He had known Prime\\r\\nMinisters. His affections were understood to be deep. And if it were\\r\\ntrue that he had not taken part in any of the great movements of the\\r\\ntime or held important office, one or two humble reforms stood to his\\r\\ncredit; an improvement in public shelters was one; the protection of\\r\\nowls in Norfolk another; servant girls had reason to be grateful to\\r\\nhim; and his name at the end of letters to the   asking\\r\\nfor funds, appealing to the public to protect, to preserve, to clear\\r\\nup litter, to abate smoke, and stamp out immorality in parks,\\r\\ncommanded respect. A magnificent figure he cut too, pausing for a moment (as the\\r\\nsound of the half hour died away) to look critically, magisterially,\\r\\nat socks and shoes; impeccable, substantial, as if he beheld the\\r\\nworld from a certain eminence, and dressed to match; but realised the\\r\\nobligations which size, wealth, health, entail, and observed\\r\\npunctiliously even when not absolutely necessary, little courtesies,\\r\\nold-fashioned ceremonies which gave a quality to his manner,\\r\\nsomething to imitate, something to remember him by, for he would\\r\\nnever lunch, for example, with Lady Bruton, whom he had known these\\r\\ntwenty years, without bringing her in his outstretched hand a bunch\\r\\nof carnations and asking Miss Brush, Lady Bruton\\'s secretary, after\\r\\nher brother in South Africa, which, for some reason, Miss Brush,\\r\\ndeficient though she was in every attribute of female charm, so much\\r\\nresented that she said \"Thank you, he\\'s doing very well in South\\r\\nAfrica,\" when, for half a dozen years, he had been doing badly in\\r\\nPortsmouth. Lady Bruton herself preferred Richard Dalloway, who arrived at the\\r\\nnext moment. Indeed they met on the doorstep. Lady Bruton preferred Richard Dalloway of course. He was made of\\r\\nmuch finer material. But she wouldn\\'t let them run down her poor dear\\r\\nHugh. She could never forget his kindness--he had been really\\r\\nremarkably kind--she forgot precisely upon what occasion. But he had\\r\\nbeen--remarkably kind. Anyhow, the difference between one man and\\r\\nanother does not amount to much. She had never seen the sense of\\r\\ncutting people up, as Clarissa Dalloway did--cutting them up and\\r\\nsticking them together again; not at any rate when one was sixty-two.\\r\\nShe took Hugh\\'s carnations with her angular grim smile. There was\\r\\nnobody else coming, she said. She had got them there on false\\r\\npretences, to help her out of a difficulty-- \"But let us eat first,\" she said. And so there began a soundless and exquisite passing to and fro\\r\\nthrough swing doors of aproned white-capped maids, handmaidens not of\\r\\nnecessity, but adepts in a mystery or grand deception practised by\\r\\nhostesses in Mayfair from one-thirty to two, when, with a wave of the\\r\\nhand, the traffic ceases, and there rises instead this profound\\r\\nillusion in the first place about the food--how it is not paid for;\\r\\nand then that the table spreads itself voluntarily with glass and\\r\\nsilver, little mats, saucers of red fruit; films of brown cream mask\\r\\nturbot; in casseroles severed chickens swim; coloured, undomestic,\\r\\nthe fire burns; and with the wine and the coffee (not paid for) rise\\r\\njocund visions before musing eyes; gently speculative eyes; eyes to\\r\\nwhom life appears musical, mysterious; eyes now kindled to observe\\r\\ngenially the beauty of the red carnations which Lady Bruton (whose\\r\\nmovements were always angular) had laid beside her plate, so that\\r\\nHugh Whitbread, feeling at peace with the entire universe and at the\\r\\nsame time completely sure of his standing, said, resting his\\r\\nfork, \"Wouldn\\'t they look charming against your lace?\" Miss Brush resented this familiarity intensely. She thought him an\\r\\nunderbred fellow. She made Lady Bruton laugh. Lady Bruton raised the carnations, holding them rather stiffly\\r\\nwith much the same attitude with which the General held the scroll in\\r\\nthe picture behind her; she remained fixed, tranced. Which was she\\r\\nnow, the General\\'s great-grand-daughter? great-great-grand-daughter?\\r\\nRichard Dalloway asked himself. Sir Roderick, Sir Miles, Sir\\r\\nTalbot--that was it. It was remarkable how in that family the\\r\\nlikeness persisted in the women. She should have been a general of\\r\\ndragoons herself. And Richard would have served under her,\\r\\ncheerfully; he had the greatest respect for her; he cherished these\\r\\nromantic views about well-set-up old women of pedigree, and would\\r\\nhave liked, in his good-humoured way, to bring some young hot-heads\\r\\nof his acquaintance to lunch with her; as if a type like hers could\\r\\nbe bred of amiable tea-drinking enthusiasts! He knew her country. He\\r\\nknew her people. There was a vine, still bearing, which either\\r\\nLovelace or Herrick--she never read a word poetry of herself, but so\\r\\nthe story ran--had sat under. Better wait to put before them the\\r\\nquestion that bothered her (about making an appeal to the public; if\\r\\nso, in what terms and so on), better wait until they have had their\\r\\ncoffee, Lady Bruton thought; and so laid the carnations down beside\\r\\nher plate. \"How\\'s Clarissa?\" she asked abruptly. Clarissa always said that Lady Bruton did not like her. Indeed,\\r\\nLady Bruton had the reputation of being more interested in politics\\r\\nthan people; of talking like a man; of having had a finger in some\\r\\nnotorious intrigue of the eighties, which was now beginning to be\\r\\nmentioned in memoirs. Certainly there was an alcove in her\\r\\ndrawing-room, and a table in that alcove, and a photograph upon that\\r\\ntable of General Sir Talbot Moore, now deceased, who had written\\r\\nthere (one evening in the eighties) in Lady Bruton\\'s presence, with\\r\\nher cognisance, perhaps advice, a telegram ordering the British\\r\\ntroops to advance upon an historical occasion. (She kept the pen and\\r\\ntold the story.) Thus, when she said in her offhand way \"How\\'s\\r\\nClarissa?\" husbands had difficulty in persuading their wives and\\r\\nindeed, however devoted, were secretly doubtful themselves, of her\\r\\ninterest in women who often got in their husbands\\' way, prevented\\r\\nthem from accepting posts abroad, and had to be taken to the seaside\\r\\nin the middle of the session to recover from influenza. Nevertheless\\r\\nher inquiry, \"How\\'s Clarissa?\" was known by women infallibly, to be a\\r\\nsignal from a well-wisher, from an almost silent companion, whose\\r\\nutterances (half a dozen perhaps in the course of a lifetime)\\r\\nsignified recognition of some feminine comradeship which went beneath\\r\\nmasculine lunch parties and united Lady Bruton and Mrs. Dalloway, who\\r\\nseldom met, and appeared when they did meet indifferent and even\\r\\nhostile, in a singular bond. \"I met Clarissa in the Park this morning,\" said Hugh Whitbread,\\r\\ndiving into the casserole, anxious to pay himself this little\\r\\ntribute, for he had only to come to London and he met everybody at\\r\\nonce; but greedy, one of the greediest men she had ever known, Milly\\r\\nBrush thought, who observed men with unflinching rectitude, and was\\r\\ncapable of everlasting devotion, to her own sex in particular, being\\r\\nknobbed, scraped, angular, and entirely without feminine charm. \"D\\'you know who\\'s in town?\" said Lady Bruton suddenly bethinking\\r\\nher. \"Our old friend, Peter Walsh.\" They all smiled. Peter Walsh! And Mr. Dalloway was genuinely glad,\\r\\nMilly Brush thought; and Mr. Whitbread thought only of his\\r\\nchicken. Peter Walsh! All three, Lady Bruton, Hugh Whitbread, and Richard\\r\\nDalloway, remembered the same thing--how passionately Peter had been\\r\\nin love; been rejected; gone to India; come a cropper; made a mess of\\r\\nthings; and Richard Dalloway had a very great liking for the dear old\\r\\nfellow too. Milly Brush saw that; saw a depth in the brown of his\\r\\neyes; saw him hesitate; consider; which interested her, as Mr.\\r\\nDalloway always interested her, for what was he thinking, she\\r\\nwondered, about Peter Walsh? That Peter Walsh had been in love with Clarissa; that he would go\\r\\nback directly after lunch and find Clarissa; that he would tell her,\\r\\nin so many words, that he loved her. Yes, he would say that. Milly Brush once might almost have fallen in love with these\\r\\nsilences; and Mr. Dalloway was always so dependable; such a gentleman\\r\\ntoo. Now, being forty, Lady Bruton had only to nod, or turn her head\\r\\na little abruptly, and Milly Brush took the signal, however deeply\\r\\nshe might be sunk in these reflections of a detached spirit, of an\\r\\nuncorrupted soul whom life could not bamboozle, because life had not\\r\\noffered her a trinket of the slightest value; not a curl, smile, lip,\\r\\ncheek, nose; nothing whatever; Lady Bruton had only to nod, and\\r\\nPerkins was instructed to quicken the coffee. \"Yes; Peter Walsh has come back,\" said Lady Bruton. It was vaguely\\r\\nflattering to them all. He had come back, battered, unsuccessful, to\\r\\ntheir secure shores. But to help him, they reflected, was impossible;\\r\\nthere was some flaw in his character. Hugh Whitbread said one might\\r\\nof course mention his name to So-and-so. He wrinkled lugubriously,\\r\\nconsequentially, at the thought of the letters he would write to the\\r\\nheads of Government offices about \"my old friend, Peter Walsh,\" and\\r\\nso on. But it wouldn\\'t lead to anything--not to anything permanent,\\r\\nbecause of his character. \"In trouble with some woman,\" said Lady Bruton. They had all\\r\\nguessed that   was at the bottom of it. \"However,\" said Lady Bruton, anxious to leave the subject, \"we\\r\\nshall hear the whole story from Peter himself.\" (The coffee was very slow in coming.) \"The address?\" murmured Hugh Whitbread; and there was at once a\\r\\nripple in the grey tide of service which washed round Lady Bruton day\\r\\nin, day out, collecting, intercepting, enveloping her in a fine\\r\\ntissue which broke concussions, mitigated interruptions, and spread\\r\\nround the house in Brook Street a fine net where things lodged and\\r\\nwere picked out accurately, instantly, by grey-haired Perkins, who\\r\\nhad been with Lady Bruton these thirty years and now wrote down the\\r\\naddress; handed it to Mr. Whitbread, who took out his pocket-book,\\r\\nraised his eyebrows, and slipping it in among documents of the\\r\\nhighest importance, said that he would get Evelyn to ask him to\\r\\nlunch. (They were waiting to bring the coffee until Mr. Whitbread had\\r\\nfinished.) Hugh was very slow, Lady Bruton thought. He was getting fat, she\\r\\nnoticed. Richard always kept himself in the pink of condition. She\\r\\nwas getting impatient; the whole of her being was setting positively,\\r\\nundeniably, domineeringly brushing aside all this unnecessary\\r\\ntrifling (Peter Walsh and his affairs) upon that subject which\\r\\nengaged her attention, and not merely her attention, but that fibre\\r\\nwhich was the ramrod of her soul, that essential part of her without\\r\\nwhich Millicent Bruton would not have been Millicent Bruton; that\\r\\nproject for emigrating young people of both sexes born of respectable\\r\\nparents and setting them up with a fair prospect of doing well in\\r\\nCanada. She exaggerated. She had perhaps lost her sense of\\r\\nproportion. Emigration was not to others the obvious remedy, the\\r\\nsublime conception. It was not to them (not to Hugh, or Richard, or\\r\\neven to devoted Miss Brush) the liberator of the pent egotism, which\\r\\na strong martial woman, well nourished, well descended, of direct\\r\\nimpulses, downright feelings, and little introspective power (broad\\r\\nand simple--why could not every one be broad and simple? she asked)\\r\\nfeels rise within her, once youth is past, and must eject upon some\\r\\nobject--it may be Emigration, it may be Emancipation; but whatever it\\r\\nbe, this object round which the essence of her soul is daily\\r\\nsecreted, becomes inevitably prismatic, lustrous, half looking-glass,\\r\\nhalf precious stone; now carefully hidden in case people should sneer\\r\\nat it; now proudly displayed. Emigration had become, in short,\\r\\nlargely Lady Bruton. But she had to write. And one letter to the   she used\\r\\nto say to Miss Brush, cost her more than to organise an expedition to\\r\\nSouth Africa (which she had done in the war). After a morning\\'s\\r\\nbattle beginning, tearing up, beginning again, she used to feel the\\r\\nfutility of her own womanhood as she felt it on no other occasion,\\r\\nand would turn gratefully to the thought of Hugh Whitbread who\\r\\npossessed--no one could doubt it--the art of writing letters to the\\r\\n A being so differently constituted from herself, with such a\\r\\ncommand of language; able to put things as editors like them put; had\\r\\npassions which one could not call simply greed. Lady Bruton often\\r\\nsuspended judgement upon men in deference to the mysterious accord in\\r\\nwhich they, but no woman, stood to the laws of the universe; knew how\\r\\nto put things; knew what was said; so that if Richard advised her,\\r\\nand Hugh wrote for her, she was sure of being somehow right. So she\\r\\nlet Hugh eat his soufflé; asked after poor Evelyn; waited\\r\\nuntil they were smoking, and then said, \"Milly, would you fetch the papers?\" And Miss Brush went out, came back; laid papers on the table; and\\r\\nHugh produced his fountain pen; his silver fountain pen, which had\\r\\ndone twenty years\\' service, he said, unscrewing the cap. It was still\\r\\nin perfect order; he had shown it to the makers; there was no reason,\\r\\nthey said, why it should ever wear out; which was somehow to Hugh\\'s\\r\\ncredit, and to the credit of the sentiments which his pen expressed\\r\\n(so Richard Dalloway felt) as Hugh began carefully writing capital\\r\\nletters with rings round them in the margin, and thus marvellously\\r\\nreduced Lady Bruton\\'s tangles to sense, to grammar such as the editor\\r\\nof the   Lady Bruton felt, watching the marvellous\\r\\ntransformation, must respect. Hugh was slow. Hugh was pertinacious.\\r\\nRichard said one must take risks. Hugh proposed modifications in\\r\\ndeference to people\\'s feelings, which, he said rather tartly when\\r\\nRichard laughed, \"had to be considered,\" and read out \"how,\\r\\ntherefore, we are of opinion that the times are ripe . . . the\\r\\nsuperfluous youth of our ever-increasing population . . . what we owe\\r\\nto the dead . . .\" which Richard thought all stuffing and bunkum, but\\r\\nno harm in it, of course, and Hugh went on drafting sentiments in\\r\\nalphabetical order of the highest nobility, brushing the cigar ash\\r\\nfrom his waistcoat, and summing up now and then the progress they had\\r\\nmade until, finally, he read out the draft of a letter which Lady\\r\\nBruton felt certain was a masterpiece. Could her own meaning sound\\r\\nlike that? Hugh could not guarantee that the editor would put it in; but he\\r\\nwould be meeting somebody at luncheon. Whereupon Lady Bruton, who seldom did a graceful thing, stuffed\\r\\nall Hugh\\'s carnations into the front of her dress, and flinging her\\r\\nhands out called him \"My Prime Minister!\" What she would have done\\r\\nwithout them both she did not know. They rose. And Richard Dalloway\\r\\nstrolled off as usual to have a look at the General\\'s portrait,\\r\\nbecause he meant, whenever he had a moment of leisure, to write a\\r\\nhistory of Lady Bruton\\'s family. And Millicent Bruton was very proud of her family. But they could\\r\\nwait, they could wait, she said, looking at the picture; meaning that\\r\\nher family, of military men, administrators, admirals, had been men\\r\\nof action, who had done their duty; and Richard\\'s first duty was to\\r\\nhis country, but it was a fine face, she said; and all the papers\\r\\nwere ready for Richard down at Aldmixton whenever the time came; the\\r\\nLabour Government she meant. \"Ah, the news from India!\" she\\r\\ncried. And then, as they stood in the hall taking yellow gloves from the\\r\\nbowl on the malachite table and Hugh was offering Miss Brush with\\r\\nquite unnecessary courtesy some discarded ticket or other compliment,\\r\\nwhich she loathed from the depths of her heart and blushed brick red,\\r\\nRichard turned to Lady Bruton, with his hat in his hand, and\\r\\nsaid, \"We shall see you at our party to-night?\" whereupon Lady Bruton\\r\\nresumed the magnificence which letter-writing had shattered. She\\r\\nmight come; or she might not come. Clarissa had wonderful energy.\\r\\nParties terrified Lady Bruton. But then, she was getting old. So she\\r\\nintimated, standing at her doorway; handsome; very erect; while her\\r\\nchow stretched behind her, and Miss Brush disappeared into the\\r\\nbackground with her hands full of papers. And Lady Bruton went ponderously, majestically, up to her room,\\r\\nlay, one arm extended, on the sofa. She sighed, she snored, not that\\r\\nshe was asleep, only drowsy and heavy, drowsy and heavy, like a field\\r\\nof clover in the sunshine this hot June day, with the bees going\\r\\nround and about and the yellow butterflies. Always she went back to\\r\\nthose fields down in Devonshire, where she had jumped the brooks on\\r\\nPatty, her pony, with Mortimer and Tom, her brothers. And there were\\r\\nthe dogs; there were the rats; there were her father and mother on\\r\\nthe lawn under the trees, with the tea-things out, and the beds of\\r\\ndahlias, the hollyhocks, the pampas grass; and they, little wretches,\\r\\nalways up to some mischief! stealing back through the shrubbery, so\\r\\nas not to be seen, all bedraggled from some roguery. What old nurse\\r\\nused to say about her frocks! Ah dear, she remembered--it was Wednesday in Brook Street. Those\\r\\nkind good fellows, Richard Dalloway, Hugh Whitbread, had gone this\\r\\nhot day through the streets whose growl came up to her lying on the\\r\\nsofa. Power was hers, position, income. She had lived in the\\r\\nforefront of her time. She had had good friends; known the ablest men\\r\\nof her day. Murmuring London flowed up to her, and her hand, lying on\\r\\nthe sofa back, curled upon some imaginary baton such as her\\r\\ngrandfathers might have held, holding which she seemed, drowsy and\\r\\nheavy, to be commanding battalions marching to Canada, and those good\\r\\nfellows walking across London, that territory of theirs, that little\\r\\nbit of carpet, Mayfair. And they went further and further from her, being attached to her\\r\\nby a thin thread (since they had lunched with her) which would\\r\\nstretch and stretch, get thinner and thinner as they walked across\\r\\nLondon; as if one\\'s friends were attached to one\\'s body, after\\r\\nlunching with them, by a thin thread, which (as she dozed there)\\r\\nbecame hazy with the sound of bells, striking the hour or ringing to\\r\\nservice, as a single spider\\'s thread is blotted with rain-drops, and,\\r\\nburdened, sags down. So she slept. And Richard Dalloway and Hugh Whitbread hesitated at the corner of\\r\\nConduit Street at the very moment that Millicent Bruton, lying on the\\r\\nsofa, let the thread snap; snored. Contrary winds buffeted at the\\r\\nstreet corner. They looked in at a shop window; they did not wish to\\r\\nbuy or to talk but to part, only with contrary winds buffeting the\\r\\nstreet corner, with some sort of lapse in the tides of the body, two\\r\\nforces meeting in a swirl, morning and afternoon, they paused. Some\\r\\nnewspaper placard went up in the air, gallantly, like a kite at\\r\\nfirst, then paused, swooped, fluttered; and a lady\\'s veil hung.\\r\\nYellow awnings trembled. The speed of the morning traffic slackened,\\r\\nand single carts rattled carelessly down half-empty streets. In\\r\\nNorfolk, of which Richard Dalloway was half thinking, a soft warm\\r\\nwind blew back the petals; confused the waters; ruffled the flowering\\r\\ngrasses. Haymakers, who had pitched beneath hedges to sleep away the\\r\\nmorning toil, parted curtains of green blades; moved trembling globes\\r\\nof cow parsley to see the sky; the blue, the steadfast, the blazing\\r\\nsummer sky. Aware that he was looking at a silver two-handled Jacobean mug,\\r\\nand that Hugh Whitbread admired condescendingly with airs of\\r\\nconnoisseurship a Spanish necklace which he thought of asking the\\r\\nprice of in case Evelyn might like it--still Richard was torpid;\\r\\ncould not think or move. Life had thrown up this wreckage; shop\\r\\nwindows full of coloured paste, and one stood stark with the lethargy\\r\\nof the old, stiff with the rigidity of the old, looking in. Evelyn\\r\\nWhitbread might like to buy this Spanish necklace--so she might. Yawn\\r\\nhe must. Hugh was going into the shop. \"Right you are!\" said Richard, following. Goodness knows he didn\\'t want to go buying necklaces with Hugh.\\r\\nBut there are tides in the body. Morning meets afternoon. Borne like\\r\\na frail shallop on deep, deep floods, Lady Bruton\\'s great-grandfather\\r\\nand his memoir and his campaigns in North America were whelmed and\\r\\nsunk. And Millicent Bruton too. She went under. Richard didn\\'t care a\\r\\nstraw what became of Emigration; about that letter, whether the\\r\\neditor put it in or not. The necklace hung stretched between Hugh\\'s\\r\\nadmirable fingers. Let him give it to a girl, if he must buy\\r\\njewels--any girl, any girl in the street. For the worthlessness of\\r\\nthis life did strike Richard pretty forcibly--buying necklaces for\\r\\nEvelyn. If he\\'d had a boy he\\'d have said, Work, work. But he had his\\r\\nElizabeth; he adored his Elizabeth. \"I should like to see Mr. Dubonnet,\" said Hugh in his curt worldly\\r\\nway. It appeared that this Dubonnet had the measurements of Mrs.\\r\\nWhitbread\\'s neck, or, more strangely still, knew her views upon\\r\\nSpanish jewellery and the extent of her possessions in that line\\r\\n(which Hugh could not remember). All of which seemed to Richard\\r\\nDalloway awfully odd. For he never gave Clarissa presents, except a\\r\\nbracelet two or three years ago, which had not been a success. She\\r\\nnever wore it. It pained him to remember that she never wore it. And\\r\\nas a single spider\\'s thread after wavering here and there attaches\\r\\nitself to the point of a leaf, so Richard\\'s mind, recovering from its\\r\\nlethargy, set now on his wife, Clarissa, whom Peter Walsh had loved\\r\\nso passionately; and Richard had had a sudden vision of her there at\\r\\nluncheon; of himself and Clarissa; of their life together; and he\\r\\ndrew the tray of old jewels towards him, and taking up first this\\r\\nbrooch then that ring, \"How much is that?\" he asked, but doubted his\\r\\nown taste. He wanted to open the drawing-room door and come in\\r\\nholding out something; a present for Clarissa. Only what? But Hugh\\r\\nwas on his legs again. He was unspeakably pompous. Really, after\\r\\ndealing here for thirty-five years he was not going to be put off by\\r\\na mere boy who did not know his business. For Dubonnet, it seemed,\\r\\nwas out, and Hugh would not buy anything until Mr. Dubonnet chose to\\r\\nbe in; at which the youth flushed and bowed his correct little bow.\\r\\nIt was all perfectly correct. And yet Richard couldn\\'t have said that\\r\\nto save his life! Why these people stood that damned insolence he\\r\\ncould not conceive. Hugh was becoming an intolerable ass. Richard\\r\\nDalloway could not stand more than an hour of his society. And,\\r\\nflicking his bowler hat by way of farewell, Richard turned at the\\r\\ncorner of Conduit Street eager, yes, very eager, to travel that\\r\\nspider\\'s thread of attachment between himself and Clarissa; he would\\r\\ngo straight to her, in Westminster. But he wanted to come in holding something. Flowers? Yes, flowers,\\r\\nsince he did not trust his taste in gold; any number of flowers,\\r\\nroses, orchids, to celebrate what was, reckoning things as you will,\\r\\nan event; this feeling about her when they spoke of Peter Walsh at\\r\\nluncheon; and they never spoke of it; not for years had they spoken\\r\\nof it; which, he thought, grasping his red and white roses together\\r\\n(a vast bunch in tissue paper), is the greatest mistake in the world.\\r\\nThe time comes when it can\\'t be said; one\\'s too shy to say it, he\\r\\nthought, pocketing his sixpence or two of change, setting off with\\r\\nhis great bunch held against his body to Westminster to say straight\\r\\nout in so many words (whatever she might think of him), holding out\\r\\nhis flowers, \"I love you.\" Why not? Really it was a miracle thinking\\r\\nof the war, and thousands of poor chaps, with all their lives before\\r\\nthem, shovelled together, already half forgotten; it was a miracle.\\r\\nHere he was walking across London to say to Clarissa in so many words\\r\\nthat he loved her. Which one never does say, he thought. Partly one\\'s\\r\\nlazy; partly one\\'s shy. And Clarissa--it was difficult to think of\\r\\nher; except in starts, as at luncheon, when he saw her quite\\r\\ndistinctly; their whole life. He stopped at the crossing; and\\r\\nrepeated--being simple by nature, and undebauched, because he had\\r\\ntramped, and shot; being pertinacious and dogged, having championed\\r\\nthe down-trodden and followed his instincts in the House of Commons;\\r\\nbeing preserved in his simplicity yet at the same time grown rather\\r\\nspeechless, rather stiff--he repeated that it was a miracle that he\\r\\nshould have married Clarissa; a miracle--his life had been a miracle,\\r\\nhe thought; hesitating to cross. But it did make his blood boil to\\r\\nsee little creatures of five or six crossing Piccadilly alone. The\\r\\npolice ought to have stopped the traffic at once. He had no illusions\\r\\nabout the London police. Indeed, he was collecting evidence of their\\r\\nmalpractices; and those costermongers, not allowed to stand their\\r\\nbarrows in the streets; and prostitutes, good Lord, the fault wasn\\'t\\r\\nin them, nor in young men either, but in our detestable social system\\r\\nand so forth; all of which he considered, could be seen considering,\\r\\ngrey, dogged, dapper, clean, as he walked across the Park to tell his\\r\\nwife that he loved her. For he would say it in so many words, when he came into the room.\\r\\nBecause it is a thousand pities never to say what one feels, he\\r\\nthought, crossing the Green Park and observing with pleasure how in\\r\\nthe shade of the trees whole families, poor families, were sprawling;\\r\\nchildren kicking up their legs; sucking milk; paper bags thrown\\r\\nabout, which could easily be picked up (if people objected) by one of\\r\\nthose fat gentlemen in livery; for he was of opinion that every park,\\r\\nand every square, during the summer months should be open to children\\r\\n(the grass of the park flushed and faded, lighting up the poor\\r\\nmothers of Westminster and their crawling babies, as if a yellow lamp\\r\\nwere moved beneath). But what could be done for female vagrants like\\r\\nthat poor creature, stretched on her elbow (as if she had flung\\r\\nherself on the earth, rid of all ties, to observe curiously, to\\r\\nspeculate boldly, to consider the whys and the wherefores, impudent,\\r\\nloose-lipped, humorous), he did not know. Bearing his flowers like a\\r\\nweapon, Richard Dalloway approached her; intent he passed her; still\\r\\nthere was time for a spark between them--she laughed at the sight of\\r\\nhim, he smiled good-humouredly, considering the problem of the female\\r\\nvagrant; not that they would ever speak. But he would tell Clarissa\\r\\nthat he loved her, in so many words. He had, once upon a time, been\\r\\njealous of Peter Walsh; jealous of him and Clarissa. But she had\\r\\noften said to him that she had been right not to marry Peter Walsh;\\r\\nwhich, knowing Clarissa, was obviously true; she wanted support. Not\\r\\nthat she was weak; but she wanted support. As for Buckingham Palace (like an old prima donna facing the\\r\\naudience all in white) you can\\'t deny it a certain dignity, he\\r\\nconsidered, nor despise what does, after all, stand to millions of\\r\\npeople (a little crowd was waiting at the gate to see the King drive\\r\\nout) for a symbol, absurd though it is; a child with a box of bricks\\r\\ncould have done better, he thought; looking at the memorial to Queen\\r\\nVictoria (whom he could remember in her horn spectacles driving\\r\\nthrough Kensington), its white mound, its billowing motherliness; but\\r\\nhe liked being ruled by the descendant of Horsa; he liked continuity;\\r\\nand the sense of handing on the traditions of the past. It was a\\r\\ngreat age in which to have lived. Indeed, his own life was a miracle;\\r\\nlet him make no mistake about it; here he was, in the prime of life,\\r\\nwalking to his house in Westminster to tell Clarissa that he loved\\r\\nher. Happiness is this he thought. It is this, he said, as he entered Dean\\'s Yard. Big Ben was\\r\\nbeginning to strike, first the warning, musical; then the hour,\\r\\nirrevocable. Lunch parties waste the entire afternoon, he thought,\\r\\napproaching his door. The sound of Big Ben flooded Clarissa\\'s drawing-room, where she\\r\\nsat, ever so annoyed, at her writing-table; worried; annoyed. It was\\r\\nperfectly true that she had not asked Ellie Henderson to her party;\\r\\nbut she had done it on purpose. Now Mrs. Marsham wrote \"she had told\\r\\nEllie Henderson she would ask Clarissa--Ellie so much wanted to\\r\\ncome.\" But why should she invite all the dull women in London to her\\r\\nparties? Why should Mrs. Marsham interfere? And there was Elizabeth\\r\\ncloseted all this time with Doris Kilman. Anything more nauseating\\r\\nshe could not conceive. Prayer at this hour with that woman. And the\\r\\nsound of the bell flooded the room with its melancholy wave; which\\r\\nreceded, and gathered itself together to fall once more, when she\\r\\nheard, distractingly, something fumbling, something scratching at the\\r\\ndoor. Who at this hour? Three, good Heavens! Three already! For with\\r\\noverpowering directness and dignity the clock struck three; and she\\r\\nheard nothing else; but the door handle slipped round and in came\\r\\nRichard! What a surprise! In came Richard, holding out flowers. She\\r\\nhad failed him, once at Constantinople; and Lady Bruton, whose lunch\\r\\nparties were said to be extraordinarily amusing, had not asked her.\\r\\nHe was holding out flowers--roses, red and white roses. (But he could\\r\\nnot bring himself to say he loved her; not in so many words.) But how lovely, she said, taking his flowers. She understood; she\\r\\nunderstood without his speaking; his Clarissa. She put them in vases\\r\\non the mantelpiece. How lovely they looked! she said. And was it\\r\\namusing, she asked? Had Lady Bruton asked after her? Peter Walsh was\\r\\nback. Mrs. Marsham had written. Must she ask Ellie Henderson? That\\r\\nwoman Kilman was upstairs. \"But let us sit down for five minutes,\" said Richard. It all looked so empty. All the chairs were against the wall. What\\r\\nhad they been doing? Oh, it was for the party; no, he had not\\r\\nforgotten, the party. Peter Walsh was back. Oh yes; she had had him.\\r\\nAnd he was going to get a divorce; and he was in love with some woman\\r\\nout there. And he hadn\\'t changed in the slightest. There she was,\\r\\nmending her dress. . . . \"Thinking of Bourton,\" she said. \"Hugh was at lunch,\" said Richard. She had met him too! Well, he\\r\\nwas getting absolutely intolerable. Buying Evelyn necklaces; fatter\\r\\nthan ever; an intolerable ass. \"And it came over me \\'I might have married you,\\'\" she said,\\r\\nthinking of Peter sitting there in his little bow-tie; with that\\r\\nknife, opening it, shutting it. \"Just as he always was, you\\r\\nknow.\" They were talking about him at lunch, said Richard. (But he could\\r\\nnot tell her he loved her. He held her hand. Happiness is this, he\\r\\nthought.) They had been writing a letter to the   for\\r\\nMillicent Bruton. That was about all Hugh was fit for. \"And our dear Miss Kilman?\" he asked. Clarissa thought the roses\\r\\nabsolutely lovely; first bunched together; now of their own accord\\r\\nstarting apart. \"Kilman arrives just as we\\'ve done lunch,\" she said. \"Elizabeth\\r\\nturns pink. They shut themselves up. I suppose they\\'re praying.\" Lord! He didn\\'t like it; but these things pass over if you let\\r\\nthem. \"In a mackintosh with an umbrella,\" said Clarissa. He had not said \"I love you\"; but he held her hand. Happiness is\\r\\nthis, is this, he thought. \"But why should I ask all the dull women in London to my parties?\"\\r\\nsaid Clarissa. And if Mrs. Marsham gave a party, did  \\r\\ninvite her guests? \"Poor Ellie Henderson,\" said Richard--it was a very odd thing how\\r\\nmuch Clarissa minded about her parties, he thought. But Richard had no notion of the look of a room. However--what was\\r\\nhe going to say? If she worried about these parties he would not let her give them.\\r\\nDid she wish she had married Peter? But he must go. He must be off, he said, getting up. But he stood for a moment as\\r\\nif he were about to say something; and she wondered what? Why? There\\r\\nwere the roses. \"Some Committee?\" she asked, as he opened the door. \"Armenians,\" he said; or perhaps it was \"Albanians.\" And there is a dignity in people; a solitude; even between husband\\r\\nand wife a gulf; and that one must respect, thought Clarissa,\\r\\nwatching him open the door; for one would not part with it oneself,\\r\\nor take it, against his will, from one\\'s husband, without losing\\r\\none\\'s independence, one\\'s self-respect--something, after all,\\r\\npriceless. He returned with a pillow and a quilt. \"An hour\\'s complete rest after luncheon,\" he said. And he\\r\\nwent. How like him! He would go on saying \"An hour\\'s complete rest after\\r\\nluncheon\" to the end of time, because a doctor had ordered it once.\\r\\nIt was like him to take what doctors said literally; part of his\\r\\nadorable, divine simplicity, which no one had to the same extent;\\r\\nwhich made him go and do the thing while she and Peter frittered\\r\\ntheir time away bickering. He was already halfway to the House of\\r\\nCommons, to his Armenians, his Albanians, having settled her on the\\r\\nsofa, looking at his roses. And people would say, \"Clarissa Dalloway\\r\\nis spoilt.\" She cared much more for her roses than for the Armenians.\\r\\nHunted out of existence, maimed, frozen, the victims of cruelty and\\r\\ninjustice (she had heard Richard say so over and over again)--no, she\\r\\ncould feel nothing for the Albanians, or was it the Armenians? but\\r\\nshe loved her roses (didn\\'t that help the Armenians?)--the only\\r\\nflowers she could bear to see cut. But Richard was already at the\\r\\nHouse of Commons; at his Committee, having settled all her\\r\\ndifficulties. But no; alas, that was not true. He did not see the\\r\\nreasons against asking Ellie Henderson. She would do it, of course,\\r\\nas he wished it. Since he had brought the pillows, she would lie\\r\\ndown. . . . But--but--why did she suddenly feel, for no reason that\\r\\nshe could discover, desperately unhappy? As a person who has dropped\\r\\nsome grain of pearl or diamond into the grass and parts the tall\\r\\nblades very carefully, this way and that, and searches here and there\\r\\nvainly, and at last spies it there at the roots, so she went through\\r\\none thing and another; no, it was not Sally Seton saying that Richard\\r\\nwould never be in the Cabinet because he had a second-class brain (it\\r\\ncame back to her); no, she did not mind that; nor was it to do with\\r\\nElizabeth either and Doris Kilman; those were facts. It was a\\r\\nfeeling, some unpleasant feeling, earlier in the day perhaps;\\r\\nsomething that Peter had said, combined with some depression of her\\r\\nown, in her bedroom, taking off her hat; and what Richard had said\\r\\nhad added to it, but what had he said? There were his roses. Her\\r\\nparties! That was it! Her parties! Both of them criticised her very\\r\\nunfairly, laughed at her very unjustly, for her parties. That was it!\\r\\nThat was it! Well, how was she going to defend herself? Now that she knew what\\r\\nit was, she felt perfectly happy. They thought, or Peter at any rate\\r\\nthought, that she enjoyed imposing herself; liked to have famous\\r\\npeople about her; great names; was simply a snob in short. Well,\\r\\nPeter might think so. Richard merely thought it foolish of her to\\r\\nlike excitement when she knew it was bad for her heart. It was\\r\\nchildish, he thought. And both were quite wrong. What she liked was\\r\\nsimply life. \"That\\'s what I do it for,\" she said, speaking aloud, to life. Since she was lying on the sofa, cloistered, exempt, the presence\\r\\nof this thing which she felt to be so obvious became physically\\r\\nexistent; with robes of sound from the street, sunny, with hot\\r\\nbreath, whispering, blowing out the blinds. But suppose Peter said to\\r\\nher, \"Yes, yes, but your parties--what\\'s the sense of your parties?\"\\r\\nall she could say was (and nobody could be expected to understand):\\r\\nThey\\'re an offering; which sounded horribly vague. But who was Peter\\r\\nto make out that life was all plain sailing?--Peter always in love,\\r\\nalways in love with the wrong woman? What\\'s your love? she might say\\r\\nto him. And she knew his answer; how it is the most important thing\\r\\nin the world and no woman possibly understood it. Very well. But\\r\\ncould any man understand what she meant either? about life? She could\\r\\nnot imagine Peter or Richard taking the trouble to give a party for\\r\\nno reason whatever. But to go deeper, beneath what people said (and these judgements,\\r\\nhow superficial, how fragmentary they are!) in her own mind now, what\\r\\ndid it mean to her, this thing she called life? Oh, it was very\\r\\nqueer. Here was So-and-so in South Kensington; some one up in\\r\\nBayswater; and somebody else, say, in Mayfair. And she felt quite\\r\\ncontinuously a sense of their existence; and she felt what a waste;\\r\\nand she felt what a pity; and she felt if only they could be brought\\r\\ntogether; so she did it. And it was an offering; to combine, to\\r\\ncreate; but to whom? An offering for the sake of offering, perhaps. Anyhow, it was her\\r\\ngift. Nothing else had she of the slightest importance; could not\\r\\nthink, write, even play the piano. She muddled Armenians and Turks;\\r\\nloved success; hated discomfort; must be liked; talked oceans of\\r\\nnonsense: and to this day, ask her what the Equator was, and she did\\r\\nnot know. All the same, that one day should follow another;\\r\\nWednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday; that one should wake up in the\\r\\nmorning; see the sky; walk in the park; meet Hugh Whitbread; then\\r\\nsuddenly in came Peter; then these roses; it was enough. After that,\\r\\nhow unbelievable death was!--that it must end; and no one in the\\r\\nwhole world would know how she had loved it all; how, every instant .\\r\\n. . The door opened. Elizabeth knew that her mother was resting. She\\r\\ncame in very quietly. She stood perfectly still. Was it that some\\r\\nMongol had been wrecked on the coast of Norfolk (as Mrs. Hilbery\\r\\nsaid), had mixed with the Dalloway ladies, perhaps, a hundred years\\r\\nago? For the Dalloways, in general, were fair-haired; blue-eyed;\\r\\nElizabeth, on the contrary, was dark; had Chinese eyes in a pale\\r\\nface; an Oriental mystery; was gentle, considerate, still. As a\\r\\nchild, she had had a perfect sense of humour; but now at seventeen,\\r\\nwhy, Clarissa could not in the least understand, she had become very\\r\\nserious; like a hyacinth, sheathed in glossy green, with buds just\\r\\ntinted, a hyacinth which has had no sun. She stood quite still and looked at her mother; but the door was\\r\\najar, and outside the door was Miss Kilman, as Clarissa knew; Miss\\r\\nKilman in her mackintosh, listening to whatever they said. Yes, Miss Kilman stood on the landing, and wore a mackintosh; but\\r\\nhad her reasons. First, it was cheap; second, she was over forty; and\\r\\ndid not, after all, dress to please. She was poor, moreover;\\r\\ndegradingly poor. Otherwise she would not be taking jobs from people\\r\\nlike the Dalloways; from rich people, who liked to be kind. Mr.\\r\\nDalloway, to do him justice, had been kind. But Mrs. Dalloway had\\r\\nnot. She had been merely condescending. She came from the most\\r\\nworthless of all classes--the rich, with a smattering of culture.\\r\\nThey had expensive things everywhere; pictures, carpets, lots of\\r\\nservants. She considered that she had a perfect right to anything\\r\\nthat the Dalloways did for her. She had been cheated. Yes, the word was no exaggeration, for\\r\\nsurely a girl has a right to some kind of happiness? And she had\\r\\nnever been happy, what with being so clumsy and so poor. And then,\\r\\njust as she might have had a chance at Miss Dolby\\'s school, the war\\r\\ncame; and she had never been able to tell lies. Miss Dolby thought\\r\\nshe would be happier with people who shared her views about the\\r\\nGermans. She had had to go. It was true that the family was of German\\r\\norigin; spelt the name Kiehlman in the eighteenth century; but her\\r\\nbrother had been killed. They turned her out because she would not\\r\\npretend that the Germans were all villains--when she had German\\r\\nfriends, when the only happy days of her life had been spent in\\r\\nGermany! And after all, she could read history. She had had to take\\r\\nwhatever she could get. Mr. Dalloway had come across her working for\\r\\nthe Friends. He had allowed her (and that was really generous of him)\\r\\nto teach his daughter history. Also she did a little Extension\\r\\nlecturing and so on. Then Our Lord had come to her (and here she\\r\\nalways bowed her head). She had seen the light two years and three\\r\\nmonths ago. Now she did not envy women like Clarissa Dalloway; she\\r\\npitied them. She pitied and despised them from the bottom of her heart, as she\\r\\nstood on the soft carpet, looking at the old engraving of a little\\r\\ngirl with a muff. With all this luxury going on, what hope was there\\r\\nfor a better state of things? Instead of lying on a sofa--\"My mother\\r\\nis resting,\" Elizabeth had said--she should have been in a factory;\\r\\nbehind a counter; Mrs. Dalloway and all the other fine ladies! Bitter and burning, Miss Kilman had turned into a church two years\\r\\nthree months ago. She had heard the Rev. Edward Whittaker preach; the\\r\\nboys sing; had seen the solemn lights descend, and whether it was the\\r\\nmusic, or the voices (she herself when alone in the evening found\\r\\ncomfort in a violin; but the sound was excruciating; she had no ear),\\r\\nthe hot and turbulent feelings which boiled and surged in her had\\r\\nbeen assuaged as she sat there, and she had wept copiously, and gone\\r\\nto call on Mr. Whittaker at his private house in Kensington. It was\\r\\nthe hand of God, he said. The Lord had shown her the way. So now,\\r\\nwhenever the hot and painful feelings boiled within her, this hatred\\r\\nof Mrs. Dalloway, this grudge against the world, she thought of God.\\r\\nShe thought of Mr. Whittaker. Rage was succeeded by calm. A sweet\\r\\nsavour filled her veins, her lips parted, and, standing formidable\\r\\nupon the landing in her mackintosh, she looked with steady and\\r\\nsinister serenity at Mrs. Dalloway, who came out with her\\r\\ndaughter. Elizabeth said she had forgotten her gloves. That was because Miss\\r\\nKilman and her mother hated each other. She could not bear to see\\r\\nthem together. She ran upstairs to find her gloves. But Miss Kilman did not hate Mrs. Dalloway. Turning her large\\r\\ngooseberry-coloured eyes upon Clarissa, observing her small pink\\r\\nface, her delicate body, her air of freshness and fashion, Miss\\r\\nKilman felt, Fool! Simpleton! You who have known neither sorrow nor\\r\\npleasure; who have trifled your life away! And there rose in her an\\r\\novermastering desire to overcome her; to unmask her. If she could\\r\\nhave felled her it would have eased her. But it was not the body; it\\r\\nwas the soul and its mockery that she wished to subdue; make feel her\\r\\nmastery. If only she could make her weep; could ruin her; humiliate\\r\\nher; bring her to her knees crying, You are right! But this was God\\'s\\r\\nwill, not Miss Kilman\\'s. It was to be a religious victory. So she\\r\\nglared; so she glowered. Clarissa was really shocked. This a Christian--this woman! This\\r\\nwoman had taken her daughter from her! She in touch with invisible\\r\\npresences! Heavy, ugly, commonplace, without kindness or grace, she\\r\\nknow the meaning of life! \"You are taking Elizabeth to the Stores?\" Mrs. Dalloway said. Miss Kilman said she was. They stood there. Miss Kilman was not\\r\\ngoing to make herself agreeable. She had always earned her living.\\r\\nHer knowledge of modern history was thorough in the extreme. She did\\r\\nout of her meagre income set aside so much for causes she believed\\r\\nin; whereas this woman did nothing, believed nothing; brought up her\\r\\ndaughter--but here was Elizabeth, rather out of breath, the beautiful\\r\\ngirl. So they were going to the Stores. Odd it was, as Miss Kilman stood\\r\\nthere (and stand she did, with the power and taciturnity of some\\r\\nprehistoric monster armoured for primeval warfare), how, second by\\r\\nsecond, the idea of her diminished, how hatred (which was for ideas,\\r\\nnot people) crumbled, how she lost her malignity, her size, became\\r\\nsecond by second merely Miss Kilman, in a mackintosh, whom Heaven\\r\\nknows Clarissa would have liked to help. At this dwindling of the monster, Clarissa laughed. Saying\\r\\ngood-bye, she laughed. Off they went together, Miss Kilman and Elizabeth, downstairs. With a sudden impulse, with a violent anguish, for this woman was\\r\\ntaking her daughter from her, Clarissa leant over the bannisters and\\r\\ncried out, \"Remember the party! Remember our party tonight!\" But Elizabeth had already opened the front door; there was a van\\r\\npassing; she did not answer. Love and religion! thought Clarissa, going back into the\\r\\ndrawing-room, tingling all over. How detestable, how detestable they\\r\\nare! For now that the body of Miss Kilman was not before her, it\\r\\noverwhelmed her--the idea. The cruelest things in the world, she\\r\\nthought, seeing them clumsy, hot, domineering, hypocritical,\\r\\neavesdropping, jealous, infinitely cruel and unscrupulous, dressed in\\r\\na mackintosh coat, on the landing; love and religion. Had she ever\\r\\ntried to convert any one herself? Did she not wish everybody merely\\r\\nto be themselves? And she watched out of the window the old lady\\r\\nopposite climbing upstairs. Let her climb upstairs if she wanted to;\\r\\nlet her stop; then let her, as Clarissa had often seen her, gain her\\r\\nbedroom, part her curtains, and disappear again into the background.\\r\\nSomehow one respected that--that old woman looking out of the window,\\r\\nquite unconscious that she was being watched. There was something\\r\\nsolemn in it--but love and religion would destroy that, whatever it\\r\\nwas, the privacy of the soul. The odious Kilman would destroy it. Yet\\r\\nit was a sight that made her want to cry. Love destroyed too. Everything that was fine, everything that was\\r\\ntrue went. Take Peter Walsh now. There was a man, charming, clever,\\r\\nwith ideas about everything. If you wanted to know about Pope, say,\\r\\nor Addison, or just to talk nonsense, what people were like, what\\r\\nthings meant, Peter knew better than any one. It was Peter who had\\r\\nhelped her; Peter who had lent her books. But look at the women he\\r\\nloved--vulgar, trivial, commonplace. Think of Peter in love--he came\\r\\nto see her after all these years, and what did he talk about?\\r\\nHimself. Horrible passion! she thought. Degrading passion! she\\r\\nthought, thinking of Kilman and her Elizabeth walking to the Army and\\r\\nNavy Stores. Big Ben struck the half-hour. How extraordinary it was, strange, yes, touching, to see the old\\r\\nlady (they had been neighbours ever so many years) move away from the\\r\\nwindow, as if she were attached to that sound, that string. Gigantic\\r\\nas it was, it had something to do with her. Down, down, into the\\r\\nmidst of ordinary things the finger fell making the moment solemn.\\r\\nShe was forced, so Clarissa imagined, by that sound, to move, to\\r\\ngo--but where? Clarissa tried to follow her as she turned and\\r\\ndisappeared, and could still just see her white cap moving at the\\r\\nback of the bedroom. She was still there moving about at the other\\r\\nend of the room. Why creeds and prayers and mackintoshes? when,\\r\\nthought Clarissa, that\\'s the miracle, that\\'s the mystery; that old\\r\\nlady, she meant, whom she could see going from chest of drawers to\\r\\ndressing-table. She could still see her. And the supreme mystery\\r\\nwhich Kilman might say she had solved, or Peter might say he had\\r\\nsolved, but Clarissa didn\\'t believe either of them had the ghost of\\r\\nan idea of solving, was simply this: here was one room; there\\r\\nanother. Did religion solve that, or love? Love--but here the other clock, the clock which always struck two\\r\\nminutes after Big Ben, came shuffling in with its lap full of odds\\r\\nand ends, which it dumped down as if Big Ben were all very well with\\r\\nhis majesty laying down the law, so solemn, so just, but she must\\r\\nremember all sorts of little things besides--Mrs. Marsham, Ellie\\r\\nHenderson, glasses for ices--all sorts of little things came flooding\\r\\nand lapping and dancing in on the wake of that solemn stroke which\\r\\nlay flat like a bar of gold on the sea. Mrs. Marsham, Ellie\\r\\nHenderson, glasses for ices. She must telephone now at once. Volubly, troublously, the late clock sounded, coming in on the\\r\\nwake of Big Ben, with its lap full of trifles. Beaten up, broken up\\r\\nby the assault of carriages, the brutality of vans, the eager advance\\r\\nof myriads of angular men, of flaunting women, the domes and spires\\r\\nof offices and hospitals, the last relics of this lap full of odds\\r\\nand ends seemed to break, like the spray of an exhausted wave, upon\\r\\nthe body of Miss Kilman standing still in the street for a moment to\\r\\nmutter \"It is the flesh.\" It was the flesh that she must control. Clarissa Dalloway had\\r\\ninsulted her. That she expected. But she had not triumphed; she had\\r\\nnot mastered the flesh. Ugly, clumsy, Clarissa Dalloway had laughed\\r\\nat her for being that; and had revived the fleshly desires, for she\\r\\nminded looking as she did beside Clarissa. Nor could she talk as she\\r\\ndid. But why wish to resemble her? Why? She despised Mrs. Dalloway\\r\\nfrom the bottom of her heart. She was not serious. She was not good.\\r\\nHer life was a tissue of vanity and deceit. Yet Doris Kilman had been\\r\\novercome. She had, as a matter of fact, very nearly burst into tears\\r\\nwhen Clarissa Dalloway laughed at her. \"It is the flesh, it is the\\r\\nflesh,\" she muttered (it being her habit to talk aloud) trying to\\r\\nsubdue this turbulent and painful feeling as she walked down Victoria\\r\\nStreet. She prayed to God. She could not help being ugly; she could\\r\\nnot afford to buy pretty clothes. Clarissa Dalloway had laughed--but\\r\\nshe would concentrate her mind upon something else until she had\\r\\nreached the pillar-box. At any rate she had got Elizabeth. But she\\r\\nwould think of something else; she would think of Russia; until she\\r\\nreached the pillar-box. How nice it must be, she said, in the country, struggling, as Mr.\\r\\nWhittaker had told her, with that violent grudge against the world\\r\\nwhich had scorned her, sneered at her, cast her off, beginning with\\r\\nthis indignity--the infliction of her unlovable body which people\\r\\ncould not bear to see. Do her hair as she might, her forehead\\r\\nremained like an egg, bald, white. No clothes suited her. She might\\r\\nbuy anything. And for a woman, of course, that meant never meeting\\r\\nthe opposite sex. Never would she come first with any one. Sometimes\\r\\nlately it had seemed to her that, except for Elizabeth, her food was\\r\\nall that she lived for; her comforts; her dinner, her tea; her\\r\\nhot-water bottle at night. But one must fight; vanquish; have faith\\r\\nin God. Mr. Whittaker had said she was there for a purpose. But no\\r\\none knew the agony! He said, pointing to the crucifix, that God knew.\\r\\nBut why should she have to suffer when other women, like Clarissa\\r\\nDalloway, escaped? Knowledge comes through suffering, said Mr.\\r\\nWhittaker. She had passed the pillar-box, and Elizabeth had turned into the\\r\\ncool brown tobacco department of the Army and Navy Stores while she\\r\\nwas still muttering to herself what Mr. Whittaker had said about\\r\\nknowledge coming through suffering and the flesh. \"The flesh,\" she\\r\\nmuttered. What department did she want? Elizabeth interrupted her. \"Petticoats,\" she said abruptly, and stalked straight on to the\\r\\nlift. Up they went. Elizabeth guided her this way and that; guided her\\r\\nin her abstraction as if she had been a great child, an unwieldy\\r\\nbattleship. There were the petticoats, brown, decorous, striped,\\r\\nfrivolous, solid, flimsy; and she chose, in her abstraction,\\r\\nportentously, and the girl serving thought her mad. Elizabeth rather wondered, as they did up the parcel, what Miss\\r\\nKilman was thinking. They must have their tea, said Miss Kilman,\\r\\nrousing, collecting herself. They had their tea. Elizabeth rather wondered whether Miss Kilman could be hungry. It\\r\\nwas her way of eating, eating with intensity, then looking, again and\\r\\nagain, at a plate of sugared cakes on the table next them; then, when\\r\\na lady and a child sat down and the child took the cake, could Miss\\r\\nKilman really mind it? Yes, Miss Kilman did mind it. She had wanted\\r\\nthat cake--the pink one. The pleasure of eating was almost the only\\r\\npure pleasure left her, and then to be baffled even in that! When people are happy, they have a reserve, she had told\\r\\nElizabeth, upon which to draw, whereas she was like a wheel without a\\r\\ntyre (she was fond of such metaphors), jolted by every pebble, so she\\r\\nwould say staying on after the lesson standing by the fire-place with\\r\\nher bag of books, her \"satchel,\" she called it, on a Tuesday morning,\\r\\nafter the lesson was over. And she talked too about the war. After\\r\\nall, there were people who did not think the English invariably\\r\\nright. There were books. There were meetings. There were other points\\r\\nof view. Would Elizabeth like to come with her to listen to So-and-so\\r\\n(a most extraordinary looking old man)? Then Miss Kilman took her to\\r\\nsome church in Kensington and they had tea with a clergyman. She had\\r\\nlent her books. Law, medicine, politics, all professions are open to\\r\\nwomen of your generation, said Miss Kilman. But for herself, her\\r\\ncareer was absolutely ruined and was it her fault? Good gracious,\\r\\nsaid Elizabeth, no. And her mother would come calling to say that a hamper had come\\r\\nfrom Bourton and would Miss Kilman like some flowers? To Miss Kilman\\r\\nshe was always very, very nice, but Miss Kilman squashed the flowers\\r\\nall in a bunch, and hadn\\'t any small talk, and what interested Miss\\r\\nKilman bored her mother, and Miss Kilman and she were terrible\\r\\ntogether; and Miss Kilman swelled and looked very plain. But then\\r\\nMiss Kilman was frightfully clever. Elizabeth had never thought about\\r\\nthe poor. They lived with everything they wanted,--her mother had\\r\\nbreakfast in bed every day; Lucy carried it up; and she liked old\\r\\nwomen because they were Duchesses, and being descended from some\\r\\nLord. But Miss Kilman said (one of those Tuesday mornings when the\\r\\nlesson was over), \"My grandfather kept an oil and colour shop in\\r\\nKensington.\" Miss Kilman made one feel so small. Miss Kilman took another cup of tea. Elizabeth, with her oriental\\r\\nbearing, her inscrutable mystery, sat perfectly upright; no, she did\\r\\nnot want anything more. She looked for her gloves--her white gloves.\\r\\nThey were under the table. Ah, but she must not go! Miss Kilman could\\r\\nnot let her go! this youth, that was so beautiful, this girl, whom\\r\\nshe genuinely loved! Her large hand opened and shut on the table. But perhaps it was a little flat somehow, Elizabeth felt. And\\r\\nreally she would like to go. But said Miss Kilman, \"I\\'ve not quite finished yet.\" Of course, then, Elizabeth would wait. But it was rather stuffy in\\r\\nhere. \"Are you going to the party to-night?\" Miss Kilman said. Elizabeth\\r\\nsupposed she was going; her mother wanted her to go. She must not let\\r\\nparties absorb her, Miss Kilman said, fingering the last two inches\\r\\nof a chocolate éclair. She did not much like parties, Elizabeth said. Miss Kilman opened\\r\\nher mouth, slightly projected her chin, and swallowed down the last\\r\\ninches of the chocolate éclair, then wiped her fingers, and\\r\\nwashed the tea round in her cup. She was about to split asunder, she felt. The agony was so\\r\\nterrific. If she could grasp her, if she could clasp her, if she\\r\\ncould make her hers absolutely and forever and then die; that was all\\r\\nshe wanted. But to sit here, unable to think of anything to say; to\\r\\nsee Elizabeth turning against her; to be felt repulsive even by\\r\\nher--it was too much; she could not stand it. The thick fingers\\r\\ncurled inwards. \"I never go to parties,\" said Miss Kilman, just to keep Elizabeth\\r\\nfrom going. \"People don\\'t ask me to parties\"--and she knew as she\\r\\nsaid it that it was this egotism that was her undoing; Mr. Whittaker\\r\\nhad warned her; but she could not help it. She had suffered so\\r\\nhorribly. \"Why should they ask me?\" she said. \"I\\'m plain, I\\'m\\r\\nunhappy.\" She knew it was idiotic. But it was all those people\\r\\npassing--people with parcels who despised her, who made her say it.\\r\\nHowever, she was Doris Kilman. She had her degree. She was a woman\\r\\nwho had made her way in the world. Her knowledge of modern history\\r\\nwas more than respectable. \"I don\\'t pity myself,\" she said. \"I pity\"--she meant to say \"your\\r\\nmother\" but no, she could not, not to Elizabeth. \"I pity other\\r\\npeople,\" she said, \"more.\" Like some dumb creature who has been brought up to a gate for an\\r\\nunknown purpose, and stands there longing to gallop away, Elizabeth\\r\\nDalloway sat silent. Was Miss Kilman going to say anything more? \"Don\\'t quite forget me,\" said Doris Kilman; her voice quivered.\\r\\nRight away to the end of the field the dumb creature galloped in\\r\\nterror. The great hand opened and shut. Elizabeth turned her head. The waitress came. One had to pay at\\r\\nthe desk, Elizabeth said, and went off, drawing out, so Miss Kilman\\r\\nfelt, the very entrails in her body, stretching them as she crossed\\r\\nthe room, and then, with a final twist, bowing her head very\\r\\npolitely, she went. She had gone. Miss Kilman sat at the marble table among the\\r\\néclairs, stricken once, twice, thrice by shocks of suffering.\\r\\nShe had gone. Mrs. Dalloway had triumphed. Elizabeth had gone. Beauty\\r\\nhad gone, youth had gone. So she sat. She got up, blundered off among the little tables,\\r\\nrocking slightly from side to side, and somebody came after her with\\r\\nher petticoat, and she lost her way, and was hemmed in by trunks\\r\\nspecially prepared for taking to India; next got among the\\r\\naccouchement sets, and baby linen; through all the commodities of the\\r\\nworld, perishable and permanent, hams, drugs, flowers, stationery,\\r\\nvariously smelling, now sweet, now sour she lurched; saw herself thus\\r\\nlurching with her hat askew, very red in the face, full length in a\\r\\nlooking-glass; and at last came out into the street. The tower of Westminster Cathedral rose in front of her, the\\r\\nhabitation of God. In the midst of the traffic, there was the\\r\\nhabitation of God. Doggedly she set off with her parcel to that other\\r\\nsanctuary, the Abbey, where, raising her hands in a tent before her\\r\\nface, she sat beside those driven into shelter too; the variously\\r\\nassorted worshippers, now divested of social rank, almost of sex, as\\r\\nthey raised their hands before their faces; but once they removed\\r\\nthem, instantly reverent, middle class, English men and women, some\\r\\nof them desirous of seeing the wax works. But Miss Kilman held her tent before her face. Now she was\\r\\ndeserted; now rejoined. New worshippers came in from the street to\\r\\nreplace the strollers, and still, as people gazed round and shuffled\\r\\npast the tomb of the Unknown Warrior, still she barred her eyes with\\r\\nher fingers and tried in this double darkness, for the light in the\\r\\nAbbey was bodiless, to aspire above the vanities, the desires, the\\r\\ncommodities, to rid herself both of hatred and of love. Her hands\\r\\ntwitched. She seemed to struggle. Yet to others God was accessible\\r\\nand the path to Him smooth. Mr. Fletcher, retired, of the Treasury,\\r\\nMrs. Gorham, widow of the famous K.C., approached Him simply, and\\r\\nhaving done their praying, leant back, enjoyed the music (the organ\\r\\npealed sweetly), and saw Miss Kilman at the end of the row, praying,\\r\\npraying, and, being still on the threshold of their underworld,\\r\\nthought of her sympathetically as a soul haunting the same territory;\\r\\na soul cut out of immaterial substance; not a woman, a soul. But Mr. Fletcher had to go. He had to pass her, and being himself\\r\\nneat as a new pin, could not help being a little distressed by the\\r\\npoor lady\\'s disorder; her hair down; her parcel on the floor. She did\\r\\nnot at once let him pass. But, as he stood gazing about him, at the\\r\\nwhite marbles, grey window panes, and accumulated treasures (for he\\r\\nwas extremely proud of the Abbey), her largeness, robustness, and\\r\\npower as she sat there shifting her knees from time to time (it was\\r\\nso rough the approach to her God--so tough her desires) impressed\\r\\nhim, as they had impressed Mrs. Dalloway (she could not get the\\r\\nthought of her out of her mind that afternoon), the Rev. Edward\\r\\nWhittaker, and Elizabeth too. And Elizabeth waited in Victoria Street for an omnibus. It was so\\r\\nnice to be out of doors. She thought perhaps she need not go home\\r\\njust yet. It was so nice to be out in the air. So she would get on to\\r\\nan omnibus. And already, even as she stood there, in her very well\\r\\ncut clothes, it was beginning. . . . People were beginning to compare\\r\\nher to poplar trees, early dawn, hyacinths, fawns, running water, and\\r\\ngarden lilies; and it made her life a burden to her, for she so much\\r\\npreferred being left alone to do what she liked in the country, but\\r\\nthey would compare her to lilies, and she had to go to parties, and\\r\\nLondon was so dreary compared with being alone in the country with\\r\\nher father and the dogs. Buses swooped, settled, were off--garish caravans, glistening with\\r\\nred and yellow varnish. But which should she get on to? She had no\\r\\npreferences. Of course, she would not push her way. She inclined to\\r\\nbe passive. It was expression she needed, but her eyes were fine,\\r\\nChinese, oriental, and, as her mother said, with such nice shoulders\\r\\nand holding herself so straight, she was always charming to look at;\\r\\nand lately, in the evening especially, when she was interested, for\\r\\nshe never seemed excited, she looked almost beautiful, very stately,\\r\\nvery serene. What could she be thinking? Every man fell in love with\\r\\nher, and she was really awfully bored. For it was beginning. Her\\r\\nmother could see that--the compliments were beginning. That she did\\r\\nnot care more about it--for instance for her clothes--sometimes\\r\\nworried Clarissa, but perhaps it was as well with all those puppies\\r\\nand guinea pigs about having distemper, and it gave her a charm. And\\r\\nnow there was this odd friendship with Miss Kilman. Well, thought\\r\\nClarissa about three o\\'clock in the morning, reading Baron Marbot for\\r\\nshe could not sleep, it proves she has a heart. Suddenly Elizabeth stepped forward and most competently boarded\\r\\nthe omnibus, in front of everybody. She took a seat on top. The\\r\\nimpetuous creature--a pirate--started forward, sprang away; she had\\r\\nto hold the rail to steady herself, for a pirate it was, reckless,\\r\\nunscrupulous, bearing down ruthlessly, circumventing dangerously,\\r\\nboldly snatching a passenger, or ignoring a passenger, squeezing\\r\\neel-like and arrogant in between, and then rushing insolently all\\r\\nsails spread up Whitehall. And did Elizabeth give one thought to poor\\r\\nMiss Kilman who loved her without jealousy, to whom she had been a\\r\\nfawn in the open, a moon in a glade? She was delighted to be free.\\r\\nThe fresh air was so delicious. It had been so stuffy in the Army and\\r\\nNavy Stores. And now it was like riding, to be rushing up Whitehall;\\r\\nand to each movement of the omnibus the beautiful body in the\\r\\nfawn-coloured coat responded freely like a rider, like the\\r\\nfigure-head of a ship, for the breeze slightly disarrayed her; the\\r\\nheat gave her cheeks the pallor of white painted wood; and her fine\\r\\neyes, having no eyes to meet, gazed ahead, blank, bright, with the\\r\\nstaring incredible innocence of sculpture. It was always talking about her own sufferings that made Miss\\r\\nKilman so difficult. And was she right? If it was being on committees\\r\\nand giving up hours and hours every day (she hardly ever saw him in\\r\\nLondon) that helped the poor, her father did that, goodness\\r\\nknows,--if that was what Miss Kilman meant about being a Christian;\\r\\nbut it was so difficult to say. Oh, she would like to go a little\\r\\nfurther. Another penny was it to the Strand? Here was another penny\\r\\nthen. She would go up the Strand. She liked people who were ill. And every profession is open to the\\r\\nwomen of your generation, said Miss Kilman. So she might be a doctor.\\r\\nShe might be a farmer. Animals are often ill. She might own a\\r\\nthousand acres and have people under her. She would go and see them\\r\\nin their cottages. This was Somerset House. One might be a very good\\r\\nfarmer--and that, strangely enough though Miss Kilman had her share\\r\\nin it, was almost entirely due to Somerset House. It looked so\\r\\nsplendid, so serious, that great grey building. And she liked the\\r\\nfeeling of people working. She liked those churches, like shapes of\\r\\ngrey paper, breasting the stream of the Strand. It was quite\\r\\ndifferent here from Westminster, she thought, getting off at Chancery\\r\\nLane. It was so serious; it was so busy. In short, she would like to\\r\\nhave a profession. She would become a doctor, a farmer, possibly go\\r\\ninto Parliament, if she found it necessary, all because of the\\r\\nStrand. The feet of those people busy about their activities, hands\\r\\nputting stone to stone, minds eternally occupied not with trivial\\r\\nchatterings (comparing women to poplars--which was rather exciting,\\r\\nof course, but very silly), but with thoughts of ships, of business,\\r\\nof law, of administration, and with it all so stately (she was in the\\r\\nTemple), gay (there was the river), pious (there was the Church),\\r\\nmade her quite determined, whatever her mother might say, to become\\r\\neither a farmer or a doctor. But she was, of course, rather lazy. And it was much better to say nothing about it. It seemed so\\r\\nsilly. It was the sort of thing that did sometimes happen, when one\\r\\nwas alone--buildings without architects\\' names, crowds of people\\r\\ncoming back from the city having more power than single clergymen in\\r\\nKensington, than any of the books Miss Kilman had lent her, to\\r\\nstimulate what lay slumbrous, clumsy, and shy on the mind\\'s sandy\\r\\nfloor to break surface, as a child suddenly stretches its arms; it\\r\\nwas just that, perhaps, a sigh, a stretch of the arms, an impulse, a\\r\\nrevelation, which has its effects for ever, and then down again it\\r\\nwent to the sandy floor. She must go home. She must dress for dinner.\\r\\nBut what was the time?--where was a clock? She looked up Fleet Street. She walked just a little way towards\\r\\nSt. Paul\\'s, shyly, like some one penetrating on tiptoe, exploring a\\r\\nstrange house by night with a candle, on edge lest the owner should\\r\\nsuddenly fling wide his bedroom door and ask her business, nor did\\r\\nshe dare wander off into queer alleys, tempting bye-streets, any more\\r\\nthan in a strange house open doors which might be bedroom doors, or\\r\\nsitting-room doors, or lead straight to the larder. For no Dalloways\\r\\ncame down the Strand daily; she was a pioneer, a stray, venturing,\\r\\ntrusting. In many ways, her mother felt, she was extremely immature, like a\\r\\nchild still, attached to dolls, to old slippers; a perfect baby; and\\r\\nthat was charming. But then, of course, there was in the Dalloway\\r\\nfamily the tradition of public service. Abbesses, principals, head\\r\\nmistresses, dignitaries, in the republic of women--without being\\r\\nbrilliant, any of them, they were that. She penetrated a little\\r\\nfurther in the direction of St. Paul\\'s. She liked the geniality,\\r\\nsisterhood, motherhood, brotherhood of this uproar. It seemed to her\\r\\ngood. The noise was tremendous; and suddenly there were trumpets (the\\r\\nunemployed) blaring, rattling about in the uproar; military music; as\\r\\nif people were marching; yet had they been dying--had some woman\\r\\nbreathed her last and whoever was watching, opening the window of the\\r\\nroom where she had just brought off that act of supreme dignity,\\r\\nlooked down on Fleet Street, that uproar, that military music would\\r\\nhave come triumphing up to him, consolatory, indifferent. It was not conscious. There was no recognition in it of one\\r\\nfortune, or fate, and for that very reason even to those dazed with\\r\\nwatching for the last shivers of consciousness on the faces of the\\r\\ndying, consoling. Forgetfulness in people might wound, their\\r\\ningratitude corrode, but this voice, pouring endlessly, year in year\\r\\nout, would take whatever it might be; this vow; this van; this life;\\r\\nthis procession, would wrap them all about and carry them on, as in\\r\\nthe rough stream of a glacier the ice holds a splinter of bone, a\\r\\nblue petal, some oak trees, and rolls them on. But it was later than she thought. Her mother would not like her\\r\\nto be wandering off alone like this. She turned back down the\\r\\nStrand. A puff of wind (in spite of the heat, there was quite a wind) blew\\r\\na thin black veil over the sun and over the Strand. The faces faded;\\r\\nthe omnibuses suddenly lost their glow. For although the clouds were\\r\\nof mountainous white so that one could fancy hacking hard chips off\\r\\nwith a hatchet, with broad golden slopes, lawns of celestial pleasure\\r\\ngardens, on their flanks, and had all the appearance of settled\\r\\nhabitations assembled for the conference of gods above the world,\\r\\nthere was a perpetual movement among them. Signs were interchanged,\\r\\nwhen, as if to fulfil some scheme arranged already, now a summit\\r\\ndwindled, now a whole block of pyramidal size which had kept its\\r\\nstation inalterably advanced into the midst or gravely led the\\r\\nprocession to fresh anchorage. Fixed though they seemed at their\\r\\nposts, at rest in perfect unanimity, nothing could be fresher, freer,\\r\\nmore sensitive superficially than the snow-white or gold-kindled\\r\\nsurface; to change, to go, to dismantle the solemn assemblage was\\r\\nimmediately possible; and in spite of the grave fixity, the\\r\\naccumulated robustness and solidity, now they struck light to the\\r\\nearth, now darkness. Calmly and competently, Elizabeth Dalloway mounted the Westminster\\r\\nomnibus. Going and coming, beckoning, signalling, so the light and shadow\\r\\nwhich now made the wall grey, now the bananas bright yellow, now made\\r\\nthe Strand grey, now made the omnibuses bright yellow, seemed to\\r\\nSeptimus Warren Smith lying on the sofa in the sitting-room; watching\\r\\nthe watery gold glow and fade with the astonishing sensibility of\\r\\nsome live creature on the roses, on the wall-paper. Outside the trees\\r\\ndragged their leaves like nets through the depths of the air; the\\r\\nsound of water was in the room and through the waves came the voices\\r\\nof birds singing. Every power poured its treasures on his head, and\\r\\nhis hand lay there on the back of the sofa, as he had seen his hand\\r\\nlie when he was bathing, floating, on the top of the waves, while far\\r\\naway on shore he heard dogs barking and barking far away. Fear no\\r\\nmore, says the heart in the body; fear no more. He was not afraid. At every moment Nature signified by some\\r\\nlaughing hint like that gold spot which went round the wall--there,\\r\\nthere, there--her determination to show, by brandishing her plumes,\\r\\nshaking her tresses, flinging her mantle this way and that,\\r\\nbeautifully, always beautifully, and standing close up to breathe\\r\\nthrough her hollowed hands Shakespeare\\'s words, her meaning. Rezia, sitting at the table twisting a hat in her hands, watched\\r\\nhim; saw him smiling. He was happy then. But she could not bear to\\r\\nsee him smiling. It was not marriage; it was not being one\\'s husband\\r\\nto look strange like that, always to be starting, laughing, sitting\\r\\nhour after hour silent, or clutching her and telling her to write.\\r\\nThe table drawer was full of those writings; about war; about\\r\\nShakespeare; about great discoveries; how there is no death. Lately\\r\\nhe had become excited suddenly for no reason (and both Dr. Holmes and\\r\\nSir William Bradshaw said excitement was the worst thing for him),\\r\\nand waved his hands and cried out that he knew the truth! He knew\\r\\neverything! That man, his friend who was killed, Evans, had come, he\\r\\nsaid. He was singing behind the screen. She wrote it down just as he\\r\\nspoke it. Some things were very beautiful; others sheer nonsense. And\\r\\nhe was always stopping in the middle, changing his mind; wanting to\\r\\nadd something; hearing something new; listening with his hand up. But she heard nothing. And once they found the girl who did the room reading one of these\\r\\npapers in fits of laughter. It was a dreadful pity. For that made\\r\\nSeptimus cry out about human cruelty--how they tear each other to\\r\\npieces. The fallen, he said, they tear to pieces. \"Holmes is on us,\"\\r\\nhe would say, and he would invent stories about Holmes; Holmes eating\\r\\nporridge; Holmes reading Shakespeare--making himself roar with\\r\\nlaughter or rage, for Dr. Holmes seemed to stand for something\\r\\nhorrible to him. \"Human nature,\" he called him. Then there were the\\r\\nvisions. He was drowned, he used to say, and lying on a cliff with\\r\\nthe gulls screaming over him. He would look over the edge of the sofa\\r\\ndown into the sea. Or he was hearing music. Really it was only a\\r\\nbarrel organ or some man crying in the street. But \"Lovely!\" he used\\r\\nto cry, and the tears would run down his cheeks, which was to her the\\r\\nmost dreadful thing of all, to see a man like Septimus, who had\\r\\nfought, who was brave, crying. And he would lie listening until\\r\\nsuddenly he would cry that he was falling down, down into the flames!\\r\\nActually she would look for flames, it was so vivid. But there was\\r\\nnothing. They were alone in the room. It was a dream, she would tell\\r\\nhim and so quiet him at last, but sometimes she was frightened too.\\r\\nShe sighed as she sat sewing. Her sigh was tender and enchanting, like the wind outside a wood\\r\\nin the evening. Now she put down her scissors; now she turned to take\\r\\nsomething from the table. A little stir, a little crinkling, a little\\r\\ntapping built up something on the table there, where she sat sewing.\\r\\nThrough his eyelashes he could see her blurred outline; her little\\r\\nblack body; her face and hands; her turning movements at the table,\\r\\nas she took up a reel, or looked (she was apt to lose things) for her\\r\\nsilk. She was making a hat for Mrs. Filmer\\'s married daughter, whose\\r\\nname was--he had forgotten her name. \"What is the name of Mrs. Filmer\\'s married daughter?\" he\\r\\nasked. \"Mrs. Peters,\" said Rezia. She was afraid it was too small, she\\r\\nsaid, holding it before her. Mrs. Peters was a big woman; but she did\\r\\nnot like her. It was only because Mrs. Filmer had been so good to\\r\\nthem. \"She gave me grapes this morning,\" she said--that Rezia wanted\\r\\nto do something to show that they were grateful. She had come into\\r\\nthe room the other evening and found Mrs. Peters, who thought they\\r\\nwere out, playing the gramophone. \"Was it true?\" he asked. She was playing the gramophone? Yes; she\\r\\nhad told him about it at the time; she had found Mrs. Peters playing\\r\\nthe gramophone. He began, very cautiously, to open his eyes, to see whether a\\r\\ngramophone was really there. But real things--real things were too\\r\\nexciting. He must be cautious. He would not go mad. First he looked\\r\\nat the fashion papers on the lower shelf, then, gradually at the\\r\\ngramophone with the green trumpet. Nothing could be more exact. And\\r\\nso, gathering courage, he looked at the sideboard; the plate of\\r\\nbananas; the engraving of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort; at\\r\\nthe mantelpiece, with the jar of roses. None of these things moved.\\r\\nAll were still; all were real. \"She is a woman with a spiteful tongue,\" said Rezia. \"What does Mr. Peters do?\" Septimus asked. \"Ah,\" said Rezia, trying to remember. She thought Mrs. Filmer had\\r\\nsaid that he travelled for some company. \"Just now he is in Hull,\"\\r\\nshe said. \"Just now!\" She said that with her Italian accent. She said that\\r\\nherself. He shaded his eyes so that he might see only a little of her\\r\\nface at a time, first the chin, then the nose, then the forehead, in\\r\\ncase it were deformed, or had some terrible mark on it. But no, there\\r\\nshe was, perfectly natural, sewing, with the pursed lips that women\\r\\nhave, the set, the melancholy expression, when sewing. But there was\\r\\nnothing terrible about it, he assured himself, looking a second time,\\r\\na third time at her face, her hands, for what was frightening or\\r\\ndisgusting in her as she sat there in broad daylight, sewing? Mrs.\\r\\nPeters had a spiteful tongue. Mr. Peters was in Hull. Why then rage\\r\\nand prophesy? Why fly scourged and outcast? Why be made to tremble\\r\\nand sob by the clouds? Why seek truths and deliver messages when\\r\\nRezia sat sticking pins into the front of her dress, and Mr. Peters\\r\\nwas in Hull? Miracles, revelations, agonies, loneliness, falling\\r\\nthrough the sea, down, down into the flames, all were burnt out, for\\r\\nhe had a sense, as he watched Rezia trimming the straw hat for Mrs.\\r\\nPeters, of a coverlet of flowers. \"It\\'s too small for Mrs. Peters,\" said Septimus. For the first time for days he was speaking as he used to do! Of\\r\\ncourse it was--absurdly small, she said. But Mrs. Peters had chosen\\r\\nit. He took it out of her hands. He said it was an organ grinder\\'s\\r\\nmonkey\\'s hat. How it rejoiced her that! Not for weeks had they laughed like this\\r\\ntogether, poking fun privately like married people. What she meant\\r\\nwas that if Mrs. Filmer had come in, or Mrs. Peters or anybody they\\r\\nwould not have understood what she and Septimus were laughing at. \"There,\" she said, pinning a rose to one side of the hat. Never\\r\\nhad she felt so happy! Never in her life! But that was still more ridiculous, Septimus said. Now the poor\\r\\nwoman looked like a pig at a fair. (Nobody ever made her laugh as\\r\\nSeptimus did.) What had she got in her work-box? She had ribbons and beads,\\r\\ntassels, artificial flowers. She tumbled them out on the table. He\\r\\nbegan putting odd colours together--for though he had no fingers,\\r\\ncould not even do up a parcel, he had a wonderful eye, and often he\\r\\nwas right, sometimes absurd, of course, but sometimes wonderfully\\r\\nright. \"She shall have a beautiful hat!\" he murmured, taking up this and\\r\\nthat, Rezia kneeling by his side, looking over his shoulder. Now it\\r\\nwas finished--that is to say the design; she must stitch it together.\\r\\nBut she must be very, very careful, he said, to keep it just as he\\r\\nhad made it. So she sewed. When she sewed, he thought, she made a sound like a\\r\\nkettle on the hob; bubbling, murmuring, always busy, her strong\\r\\nlittle pointed fingers pinching and poking; her needle flashing\\r\\nstraight. The sun might go in and out, on the tassels, on the\\r\\nwall-paper, but he would wait, he thought, stretching out his feet,\\r\\nlooking at his ringed sock at the end of the sofa; he would wait in\\r\\nthis warm place, this pocket of still air, which one comes on at the\\r\\nedge of a wood sometimes in the evening, when, because of a fall in\\r\\nthe ground, or some arrangement of the trees (one must be scientific\\r\\nabove all, scientific), warmth lingers, and the air buffets the cheek\\r\\nlike the wing of a bird. \"There it is,\" said Rezia, twirling Mrs. Peters\\' hat on the tips\\r\\nof her fingers. \"That\\'ll do for the moment. Later . . .\" her sentence\\r\\nbubbled away drip, drip, drip, like a contented tap left running. It was wonderful. Never had he done anything which made him feel\\r\\nso proud. It was so real, it was so substantial, Mrs. Peters\\'\\r\\nhat. \"Just look at it,\" he said. Yes, it would always make her happy to see that hat. He had become\\r\\nhimself then, he had laughed then. They had been alone together.\\r\\nAlways she would like that hat. He told her to try it on. \"But I must look so queer!\" she cried, running over to the glass\\r\\nand looking first this side then that. Then she snatched it off\\r\\nagain, for there was a tap at the door. Could it be Sir William\\r\\nBradshaw? Had he sent already? No! it was only the small girl with the evening paper. What always happened, then happened--what happened every night of\\r\\ntheir lives. The small girl sucked her thumb at the door; Rezia went\\r\\ndown on her knees; Rezia cooed and kissed; Rezia got a bag of sweets\\r\\nout of the table drawer. For so it always happened. First one thing,\\r\\nthen another. So she built it up, first one thing and then another.\\r\\nDancing, skipping, round and round the room they went. He took the\\r\\npaper. Surrey was all out, he read. There was a heat wave. Rezia\\r\\nrepeated: Surrey was all out. There was a heat wave, making it part\\r\\nof the game she was playing with Mrs. Filmer\\'s grandchild, both of\\r\\nthem laughing, chattering at the same time, at their game. He was\\r\\nvery tired. He was very happy. He would sleep. He shut his eyes. But\\r\\ndirectly he saw nothing the sounds of the game became fainter and\\r\\nstranger and sounded like the cries of people seeking and not\\r\\nfinding, and passing further and further away. They had lost him! He started up in terror. What did he see? The plate of bananas on\\r\\nthe sideboard. Nobody was there (Rezia had taken the child to its\\r\\nmother. It was bedtime). That was it: to be alone forever. That was\\r\\nthe doom pronounced in Milan when he came into the room and saw them\\r\\ncutting out buckram shapes with their scissors; to be alone\\r\\nforever. He was alone with the sideboard and the bananas. He was alone,\\r\\nexposed on this bleak eminence, stretched out--but not on a hill-top;\\r\\nnot on a crag; on Mrs. Filmer\\'s sitting-room sofa. As for the\\r\\nvisions, the faces, the voices of the dead, where were they? There\\r\\nwas a screen in front of him, with black bulrushes and blue swallows.\\r\\nWhere he had once seen mountains, where he had seen faces, where he\\r\\nhad seen beauty, there was a screen. \"Evans!\" he cried. There was no answer. A mouse had squeaked, or a\\r\\ncurtain rustled. Those were the voices of the dead. The screen, the\\r\\ncoalscuttle, the sideboard remained to him. Let him then face the\\r\\nscreen, the coal-scuttle and the sideboard . . . but Rezia burst into\\r\\nthe room chattering. Some letter had come. Everybody\\'s plans were changed. Mrs. Filmer\\r\\nwould not be able to go to Brighton after all. There was no time to\\r\\nlet Mrs. Williams know, and really Rezia thought it very, very\\r\\nannoying, when she caught sight of the hat and thought . . . perhaps\\r\\n. . . she . . . might just make a little. . . . Her voice died out in\\r\\ncontented melody. \"Ah, damn!\" she cried (it was a joke of theirs, her swearing), the\\r\\nneedle had broken. Hat, child, Brighton, needle. She built it up;\\r\\nfirst one thing, then another, she built it up, sewing. She wanted him to say whether by moving the rose she had improved\\r\\nthe hat. She sat on the end of the sofa. They were perfectly happy now, she said, suddenly, putting the hat\\r\\ndown. For she could say anything to him now. She could say whatever\\r\\ncame into her head. That was almost the first thing she had felt\\r\\nabout him, that night in the café when he had come in with his\\r\\nEnglish friends. He had come in, rather shyly, looking round him, and\\r\\nhis hat had fallen when he hung it up. That she could remember. She\\r\\nknew he was English, though not one of the large Englishmen her\\r\\nsister admired, for he was always thin; but he had a beautiful fresh\\r\\ncolour; and with his big nose, his bright eyes, his way of sitting a\\r\\nlittle hunched made her think, she had often told him, of a young\\r\\nhawk, that first evening she saw him, when they were playing\\r\\ndominoes, and he had come in--of a young hawk; but with her he was\\r\\nalways very gentle. She had never seen him wild or drunk, only\\r\\nsuffering sometimes through this terrible war, but even so, when she\\r\\ncame in, he would put it all away. Anything, anything in the whole\\r\\nworld, any little bother with her work, anything that struck her to\\r\\nsay she would tell him, and he understood at once. Her own family\\r\\neven were not the same. Being older than she was and being so\\r\\nclever--how serious he was, wanting her to read Shakespeare before\\r\\nshe could even read a child\\'s story in English!--being so much more\\r\\nexperienced, he could help her. And she too could help him. But this hat now. And then (it was getting late) Sir William\\r\\nBradshaw. She held her hands to her head, waiting for him to say did he like\\r\\nthe hat or not, and as she sat there, waiting, looking down, he could\\r\\nfeel her mind, like a bird, falling from branch to branch, and always\\r\\nalighting, quite rightly; he could follow her mind, as she sat there\\r\\nin one of those loose lax poses that came to her naturally and, if he\\r\\nshould say anything, at once she smiled, like a bird alighting with\\r\\nall its claws firm upon the bough. But he remembered Bradshaw said, \"The people we are most fond of\\r\\nare not good for us when we are ill.\" Bradshaw said, he must be\\r\\ntaught to rest. Bradshaw said they must be separated. \"Must,\" \"must,\" why \"must\"? What power had Bradshaw over him?\\r\\n\"What right has Bradshaw to say \\'must\\' to me?\" he demanded. \"It is because you talked of killing yourself,\" said Rezia.\\r\\n(Mercifully, she could now say anything to Septimus.) So he was in their power! Holmes and Bradshaw were on him! The\\r\\nbrute with the red nostrils was snuffing into every secret place!\\r\\n\"Must\" it could say! Where were his papers? the things he had\\r\\nwritten? She brought him his papers, the things he had written, things she\\r\\nhad written for him. She tumbled them out on to the sofa. They looked\\r\\nat them together. Diagrams, designs, little men and women brandishing\\r\\nsticks for arms, with wings--were they?--on their backs; circles\\r\\ntraced round shillings and sixpences--the suns and stars; zigzagging\\r\\nprecipices with mountaineers ascending roped together, exactly like\\r\\nknives and forks; sea pieces with little faces laughing out of what\\r\\nmight perhaps be waves: the map of the world. Burn them! he cried.\\r\\nNow for his writings; how the dead sing behind rhododendron bushes;\\r\\nodes to Time; conversations with Shakespeare; Evans, Evans,\\r\\nEvans--his messages from the dead; do not cut down trees; tell the\\r\\nPrime Minister. Universal love: the meaning of the world. Burn them!\\r\\nhe cried. But Rezia laid her hands on them. Some were very beautiful, she\\r\\nthought. She would tie them up (for she had no envelope) with a piece\\r\\nof silk. Even if they took him, she said, she would go with him. They could\\r\\nnot separate them against their wills, she said. Shuffling the edges straight, she did up the papers, and tied the\\r\\nparcel almost without looking, sitting beside him, he thought, as if\\r\\nall her petals were about her. She was a flowering tree; and through\\r\\nher branches looked out the face of a lawgiver, who had reached a\\r\\nsanctuary where she feared no one; not Holmes; not Bradshaw; a\\r\\nmiracle, a triumph, the last and greatest. Staggering he saw her\\r\\nmount the appalling staircase, laden with Holmes and Bradshaw, men\\r\\nwho never weighed less than eleven stone six, who sent their wives to\\r\\nCourt, men who made ten thousand a year and talked of proportion; who\\r\\ndifferent in their verdicts (for Holmes said one thing, Bradshaw\\r\\nanother), yet judges they were; who mixed the vision and the\\r\\nsideboard; saw nothing clear, yet ruled, yet inflicted. \"Must\" they\\r\\nsaid. Over them she triumphed. \"There!\" she said. The papers were tied up. No one should get at\\r\\nthem. She would put them away. And, she said, nothing should separate them. She sat down beside\\r\\nhim and called him by the name of that hawk or crow which being\\r\\nmalicious and a great destroyer of crops was precisely like him. No\\r\\none could separate them, she said. Then she got up to go into the bedroom to pack their things, but\\r\\nhearing voices downstairs and thinking that Dr. Holmes had perhaps\\r\\ncalled, ran down to prevent him coming up. Septimus could hear her talking to Holmes on the staircase. \"My dear lady, I have come as a friend,\" Holmes was saying. \"No. I will not allow you to see my husband,\" she said. He could see her, like a little hen, with her wings spread barring\\r\\nhis passage. But Holmes persevered. \"My dear lady, allow me . . .\" Holmes said, putting her aside\\r\\n(Holmes was a powerfully built man). Holmes was coming upstairs. Holmes would burst open the door.\\r\\nHolmes would say \"In a funk, eh?\" Holmes would get him. But no; not\\r\\nHolmes; not Bradshaw. Getting up rather unsteadily, hopping indeed\\r\\nfrom foot to foot, he considered Mrs. Filmer\\'s nice clean bread knife\\r\\nwith \"Bread\" carved on the handle. Ah, but one mustn\\'t spoil that.\\r\\nThe gas fire? But it was too late now. Holmes was coming. Razors he\\r\\nmight have got, but Rezia, who always did that sort of thing, had\\r\\npacked them. There remained only the window, the large\\r\\nBloomsbury-lodging house window, the tiresome, the troublesome, and\\r\\nrather melodramatic business of opening the window and throwing\\r\\nhimself out. It was their idea of tragedy, not his or Rezia\\'s (for\\r\\nshe was with him). Holmes and Bradshaw like that sort of thing. (He\\r\\nsat on the sill.) But he would wait till the very last moment. He did\\r\\nnot want to die. Life was good. The sun hot. Only human beings--what\\r\\ndid   want? Coming down the staircase opposite an old man\\r\\nstopped and stared at him. Holmes was at the door. \"I\\'ll give it\\r\\nyou!\" he cried, and flung himself vigorously, violently down on to\\r\\nMrs. Filmer\\'s area railings. \"The coward!\" cried Dr. Holmes, bursting the door open. Rezia ran\\r\\nto the window, she saw; she understood. Dr. Holmes and Mrs. Filmer\\r\\ncollided with each other. Mrs. Filmer flapped her apron and made her\\r\\nhide her eyes in the bedroom. There was a great deal of running up\\r\\nand down stairs. Dr. Holmes came in--white as a sheet, shaking all\\r\\nover, with a glass in his hand. She must be brave and drink\\r\\nsomething, he said (What was it? Something sweet), for her husband\\r\\nwas horribly mangled, would not recover consciousness, she must not\\r\\nsee him, must be spared as much as possible, would have the inquest\\r\\nto go through, poor young woman. Who could have foretold it? A sudden\\r\\nimpulse, no one was in the least to blame (he told Mrs. Filmer). And\\r\\nwhy the devil he did it, Dr. Holmes could not conceive. It seemed to her as she drank the sweet stuff that she was opening\\r\\nlong windows, stepping out into some garden. But where? The clock was\\r\\nstriking--one, two, three: how sensible the sound was; compared with\\r\\nall this thumping and whispering; like Septimus himself. She was\\r\\nfalling asleep. But the clock went on striking, four, five, six and\\r\\nMrs. Filmer waving her apron (they wouldn\\'t bring the body in here,\\r\\nwould they?) seemed part of that garden; or a flag. She had once seen\\r\\na flag slowly rippling out from a mast when she stayed with her aunt\\r\\nat Venice. Men killed in battle were thus saluted, and Septimus had\\r\\nbeen through the War. Of her memories, most were happy. She put on her hat, and ran through cornfields--where could it\\r\\nhave been?--on to some hill, somewhere near the sea, for there were\\r\\nships, gulls, butterflies; they sat on a cliff. In London too, there\\r\\nthey sat, and, half dreaming, came to her through the bedroom door,\\r\\nrain falling, whisperings, stirrings among dry corn, the caress of\\r\\nthe sea, as it seemed to her, hollowing them in its arched shell and\\r\\nmurmuring to her laid on shore, strewn she felt, like flying flowers\\r\\nover some tomb. \"He is dead,\" she said, smiling at the poor old woman who guarded\\r\\nher with her honest light-blue eyes fixed on the door. (They wouldn\\'t\\r\\nbring him in here, would they?) But Mrs. Filmer pooh-poohed. Oh no,\\r\\noh no! They were carrying him away now. Ought she not to be told?\\r\\nMarried people ought to be together, Mrs. Filmer thought. But they\\r\\nmust do as the doctor said. \"Let her sleep,\" said Dr. Holmes, feeling her pulse. She saw the\\r\\nlarge outline of his body standing dark against the window. So that\\r\\nwas Dr. Holmes. One of the triumphs of civilisation, Peter Walsh thought. It is\\r\\none of the triumphs of civilisation, as the light high bell of the\\r\\nambulance sounded. Swiftly, cleanly the ambulance sped to the\\r\\nhospital, having picked up instantly, humanely, some poor devil; some\\r\\none hit on the head, struck down by disease, knocked over perhaps a\\r\\nminute or so ago at one of these crossings, as might happen to\\r\\noneself. That was civilisation. It struck him coming back from the\\r\\nEast--the efficiency, the organisation, the communal spirit of\\r\\nLondon. Every cart or carriage of its own accord drew aside to let\\r\\nthe ambulance pass. Perhaps it was morbid; or was it not touching\\r\\nrather, the respect which they showed this ambulance with its victim\\r\\ninside--busy men hurrying home yet instantly bethinking them as it\\r\\npassed of some wife; or presumably how easily it might have been them\\r\\nthere, stretched on a shelf with a doctor and a nurse. . . . Ah, but\\r\\nthinking became morbid, sentimental, directly one began conjuring up\\r\\ndoctors, dead bodies; a little glow of pleasure, a sort of lust too\\r\\nover the visual impression warned one not to go on with that sort of\\r\\nthing any more--fatal to art, fatal to friendship. True. And yet,\\r\\nthought Peter Walsh, as the ambulance turned the corner though the\\r\\nlight high bell could be heard down the next street and still farther\\r\\nas it crossed the Tottenham Court Road, chiming constantly, it is the\\r\\nprivilege of loneliness; in privacy one may do as one chooses. One\\r\\nmight weep if no one saw. It had been his undoing--this\\r\\nsusceptibility--in Anglo-Indian society; not weeping at the right\\r\\ntime, or laughing either. I have that in me, he thought standing by\\r\\nthe pillar-box, which could now dissolve in tears. Why, Heaven knows.\\r\\nBeauty of some sort probably, and the weight of the day, which\\r\\nbeginning with that visit to Clarissa had exhausted him with its\\r\\nheat, its intensity, and the drip, drip, of one impression after\\r\\nanother down into that cellar where they stood, deep, dark, and no\\r\\none would ever know. Partly for that reason, its secrecy, complete\\r\\nand inviolable, he had found life like an unknown garden, full of\\r\\nturns and corners, surprising, yes; really it took one\\'s breath away,\\r\\nthese moments; there coming to him by the pillar-box opposite the\\r\\nBritish Museum one of them, a moment, in which things came together;\\r\\nthis ambulance; and life and death. It was as if he were sucked up to\\r\\nsome very high roof by that rush of emotion and the rest of him, like\\r\\na white shell-sprinkled beach, left bare. It had been his undoing in\\r\\nAnglo-Indian society--this susceptibility. Clarissa once, going on top of an omnibus with him somewhere,\\r\\nClarissa superficially at least, so easily moved, now in despair, now\\r\\nin the best of spirits, all aquiver in those days and such good\\r\\ncompany, spotting queer little scenes, names, people from the top of\\r\\na bus, for they used to explore London and bring back bags full of\\r\\ntreasures from the Caledonian market--Clarissa had a theory in those\\r\\ndays--they had heaps of theories, always theories, as young people\\r\\nhave. It was to explain the feeling they had of dissatisfaction; not\\r\\nknowing people; not being known. For how could they know each other?\\r\\nYou met every day; then not for six months, or years. It was\\r\\nunsatisfactory, they agreed, how little one knew people. But she\\r\\nsaid, sitting on the bus going up Shaftesbury Avenue, she felt\\r\\nherself everywhere; not \"here, here, here\"; and she tapped the back\\r\\nof the seat; but everywhere. She waved her hand, going up Shaftesbury\\r\\nAvenue. She was all that. So that to know her, or any one, one must\\r\\nseek out the people who completed them; even the places. Odd\\r\\naffinities she had with people she had never spoken to, some woman in\\r\\nthe street, some man behind a counter--even trees, or barns. It ended\\r\\nin a transcendental theory which, with her horror of death, allowed\\r\\nher to believe, or say that she believed (for all her scepticism),\\r\\nthat since our apparitions, the part of us which appears, are so\\r\\nmomentary compared with the other, the unseen part of us, which\\r\\nspreads wide, the unseen might survive, be recovered somehow attached\\r\\nto this person or that, or even haunting certain places after death .\\r\\n. . perhaps--perhaps. Looking back over that long friendship of almost thirty years her\\r\\ntheory worked to this extent. Brief, broken, often painful as their\\r\\nactual meetings had been what with his absences and interruptions\\r\\n(this morning, for instance, in came Elizabeth, like a long-legged\\r\\ncolt, handsome, dumb, just as he was beginning to talk to Clarissa)\\r\\nthe effect of them on his life was immeasurable. There was a mystery\\r\\nabout it. You were given a sharp, acute, uncomfortable grain--the\\r\\nactual meeting; horribly painful as often as not; yet in absence, in\\r\\nthe most unlikely places, it would flower out, open, shed its scent,\\r\\nlet you touch, taste, look about you, get the whole feel of it and\\r\\nunderstanding, after years of lying lost. Thus she had come to him;\\r\\non board ship; in the Himalayas; suggested by the oddest things (so\\r\\nSally Seton, generous, enthusiastic goose! thought of   when\\r\\nshe saw blue hydrangeas). She had influenced him more than any person\\r\\nhe had ever known. And always in this way coming before him without\\r\\nhis wishing it, cool, lady-like, critical; or ravishing, romantic,\\r\\nrecalling some field or English harvest. He saw her most often in the\\r\\ncountry, not in London. One scene after another at Bourton. . . . He had reached his hotel. He crossed the hall, with its mounds of\\r\\nreddish chairs and sofas, its spike-leaved, withered-looking plants.\\r\\nHe got his key off the hook. The young lady handed him some letters.\\r\\nHe went upstairs--he saw her most often at Bourton, in the late\\r\\nsummer, when he stayed there for a week, or fortnight even, as people\\r\\ndid in those days. First on top of some hill there she would stand,\\r\\nhands clapped to her hair, her cloak blowing out, pointing, crying to\\r\\nthem--she saw the Severn beneath. Or in a wood, making the kettle\\r\\nboil--very ineffective with her fingers; the smoke curtseying,\\r\\nblowing in their faces; her little pink face showing through; begging\\r\\nwater from an old woman in a cottage, who came to the door to watch\\r\\nthem go. They walked always; the others drove. She was bored driving,\\r\\ndisliked all animals, except that dog. They tramped miles along\\r\\nroads. She would break off to get her bearings, pilot him back across\\r\\ncountry; and all the time they argued, discussed poetry, discussed\\r\\npeople, discussed politics (she was a Radical then); never noticing a\\r\\nthing except when she stopped, cried out at a view or a tree, and\\r\\nmade him look with her; and so on again, through stubble fields, she\\r\\nwalking ahead, with a flower for her aunt, never tired of walking for\\r\\nall her delicacy; to drop down on Bourton in the dusk. Then, after\\r\\ndinner, old Breitkopf would open the piano and sing without any\\r\\nvoice, and they would lie sunk in arm-chairs, trying not to laugh,\\r\\nbut always breaking down and laughing, laughing--laughing at nothing.\\r\\nBreitkopf was supposed not to see. And then in the morning, flirting\\r\\nup and down like a wagtail in front of the house. . . . Oh it was a letter from her! This blue envelope; that was her\\r\\nhand. And he would have to read it. Here was another of those\\r\\nmeetings, bound to be painful! To read her letter needed the devil of\\r\\nan effort. \"How heavenly it was to see him. She must tell him that.\"\\r\\nThat was all. But it upset him. It annoyed him. He wished she hadn\\'t written it.\\r\\nComing on top of his thoughts, it was like a nudge in the ribs. Why\\r\\ncouldn\\'t she let him be? After all, she had married Dalloway, and\\r\\nlived with him in perfect happiness all these years. These hotels are not consoling places. Far from it. Any number of\\r\\npeople had hung up their hats on those pegs. Even the flies, if you\\r\\nthought of it, had settled on other people\\'s noses. As for the\\r\\ncleanliness which hit him in the face, it wasn\\'t cleanliness, so much\\r\\nas bareness, frigidity; a thing that had to be. Some arid matron made\\r\\nher rounds at dawn sniffing, peering, causing blue-nosed maids to\\r\\nscour, for all the world as if the next visitor were a joint of meat\\r\\nto be served on a perfectly clean platter. For sleep, one bed; for\\r\\nsitting in, one armchair; for cleaning one\\'s teeth and shaving one\\'s\\r\\nchin, one tumbler, one looking-glass. Books, letters, dressing-gown,\\r\\nslipped about on the impersonality of the horsehair like incongruous\\r\\nimpertinences. And it was Clarissa\\'s letter that made him see all\\r\\nthis. \"Heavenly to see you. She must say so!\" He folded the paper;\\r\\npushed it away; nothing would induce him to read it again! To get that letter to him by six o\\'clock she must have sat down\\r\\nand written it directly he left her; stamped it; sent somebody to the\\r\\npost. It was, as people say, very like her. She was upset by his\\r\\nvisit. She had felt a great deal; had for a moment, when she kissed\\r\\nhis hand, regretted, envied him even, remembered possibly (for he saw\\r\\nher look it) something he had said--how they would change the world\\r\\nif she married him perhaps; whereas, it was this; it was middle age;\\r\\nit was mediocrity; then forced herself with her indomitable vitality\\r\\nto put all that aside, there being in her a thread of life which for\\r\\ntoughness, endurance, power to overcome obstacles, and carry her\\r\\ntriumphantly through he had never known the like of. Yes; but there\\r\\nwould come a reaction directly he left the room. She would be\\r\\nfrightfully sorry for him; she would think what in the world she\\r\\ncould do to give him pleasure (short always of the one thing) and he\\r\\ncould see her with the tears running down her cheeks going to her\\r\\nwriting-table and dashing off that one line which he was to find\\r\\ngreeting him. . . . \"Heavenly to see you!\" And she meant it. Peter Walsh had now unlaced his boots. But it would not have been a success, their marriage. The other\\r\\nthing, after all, came so much more naturally. It was odd; it was true; lots of people felt it. Peter Walsh, who\\r\\nhad done just respectably, filled the usual posts adequately, was\\r\\nliked, but thought a little cranky, gave himself airs--it was odd\\r\\nthat   should have had, especially now that his hair was\\r\\ngrey, a contented look; a look of having reserves. It was this that\\r\\nmade him attractive to women who liked the sense that he was not\\r\\naltogether manly. There was something unusual about him, or something\\r\\nbehind him. It might be that he was bookish--never came to see you\\r\\nwithout taking up the book on the table (he was now reading, with his\\r\\nbootlaces trailing on the floor); or that he was a gentleman, which\\r\\nshowed itself in the way he knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and in\\r\\nhis manners of course to women. For it was very charming and quite\\r\\nridiculous how easily some girl without a grain of sense could twist\\r\\nhim round her finger. But at her own risk. That is to say, though he\\r\\nmight be ever so easy, and indeed with his gaiety and good-breeding\\r\\nfascinating to be with, it was only up to a point. She said\\r\\nsomething--no, no; he saw through that. He wouldn\\'t stand that--no,\\r\\nno. Then he could shout and rock and hold his sides together over\\r\\nsome joke with men. He was the best judge of cooking in India. He was\\r\\na man. But not the sort of man one had to respect--which was a mercy;\\r\\nnot like Major Simmons, for instance; not in the least like that,\\r\\nDaisy thought, when, in spite of her two small children, she used to\\r\\ncompare them. He pulled off his boots. He emptied his pockets. Out came with his\\r\\npocket-knife a snapshot of Daisy on the verandah; Daisy all in white,\\r\\nwith a fox-terrier on her knee; very charming, very dark; the best he\\r\\nhad ever seen of her. It did come, after all so naturally; so much\\r\\nmore naturally than Clarissa. No fuss. No bother. No finicking and\\r\\nfidgeting. All plain sailing. And the dark, adorably pretty girl on\\r\\nthe verandah exclaimed (he could hear her). Of course, of course she\\r\\nwould give him everything! she cried (she had no sense of discretion)\\r\\neverything he wanted! she cried, running to meet him, whoever might\\r\\nbe looking. And she was only twenty-four. And she had two children.\\r\\nWell, well! Well indeed he had got himself into a mess at his age. And it came\\r\\nover him when he woke in the night pretty forcibly. Suppose they did\\r\\nmarry? For him it would be all very well, but what about her? Mrs.\\r\\nBurgess, a good sort and no chatterbox, in whom he had confided,\\r\\nthought this absence of his in England, ostensibly to see lawyers\\r\\nmight serve to make Daisy reconsider, think what it meant. It was a\\r\\nquestion of her position, Mrs. Burgess said; the social barrier;\\r\\ngiving up her children. She\\'d be a widow with a past one of these\\r\\ndays, draggling about in the suburbs, or more likely, indiscriminate\\r\\n(you know, she said, what such women get like, with too much paint).\\r\\nBut Peter Walsh pooh-poohed all that. He didn\\'t mean to die yet.\\r\\nAnyhow she must settle for herself; judge for herself, he thought,\\r\\npadding about the room in his socks, smoothing out his dress-shirt,\\r\\nfor he might go to Clarissa\\'s party, or he might go to one of the\\r\\nHalls, or he might settle in and read an absorbing book written by a\\r\\nman he used to know at Oxford. And if he did retire, that\\'s what he\\'d\\r\\ndo--write books. He would go to Oxford and poke about in the\\r\\nBodleian. Vainly the dark, adorably pretty girl ran to the end of the\\r\\nterrace; vainly waved her hand; vainly cried she didn\\'t care a straw\\r\\nwhat people said. There he was, the man she thought the world of, the\\r\\nperfect gentleman, the fascinating, the distinguished (and his age\\r\\nmade not the least difference to her), padding about a room in an\\r\\nhotel in Bloomsbury, shaving, washing, continuing, as he took up\\r\\ncans, put down razors, to poke about in the Bodleian, and get at the\\r\\ntruth about one or two little matters that interested him. And he\\r\\nwould have a chat with whoever it might be, and so come to disregard\\r\\nmore and more precise hours for lunch, and miss engagements, and when\\r\\nDaisy asked him, as she would, for a kiss, a scene, fail to come up\\r\\nto the scratch (though he was genuinely devoted to her)--in short it\\r\\nmight be happier, as Mrs. Burgess said, that she should forget him,\\r\\nor merely remember him as he was in August 1922, like a figure\\r\\nstanding at the cross roads at dusk, which grows more and more remote\\r\\nas the dog-cart spins away, carrying her securely fastened to the\\r\\nback seat, though her arms are outstretched, and as she sees the\\r\\nfigure dwindle and disappear still she cries out how she would do\\r\\nanything in the world, anything, anything, anything. . . . He never knew what people thought. It became more and more\\r\\ndifficult for him to concentrate. He became absorbed; he became\\r\\nbusied with his own concerns; now surly, now gay; dependent on women,\\r\\nabsent-minded, moody, less and less able (so he thought as he shaved)\\r\\nto understand why Clarissa couldn\\'t simply find them a lodging and be\\r\\nnice to Daisy; introduce her. And then he could just--just do what?\\r\\njust haunt and hover (he was at the moment actually engaged in\\r\\nsorting out various keys, papers), swoop and taste, be alone, in\\r\\nshort, sufficient to himself; and yet nobody of course was more\\r\\ndependent upon others (he buttoned his waistcoat); it had been his\\r\\nundoing. He could not keep out of smoking-rooms, liked colonels,\\r\\nliked golf, liked bridge, and above all women\\'s society, and the\\r\\nfineness of their companionship, and their faithfulness and audacity\\r\\nand greatness in loving which though it had its drawbacks seemed to\\r\\nhim (and the dark, adorably pretty face was on top of the envelopes)\\r\\nso wholly admirable, so splendid a flower to grow on the crest of\\r\\nhuman life, and yet he could not come up to the scratch, being always\\r\\napt to see round things (Clarissa had sapped something in him\\r\\npermanently), and to tire very easily of mute devotion and to want\\r\\nvariety in love, though it would make him furious if Daisy loved\\r\\nanybody else, furious! for he was jealous, uncontrollably jealous by\\r\\ntemperament. He suffered tortures! But where was his knife; his\\r\\nwatch; his seals, his note-case, and Clarissa\\'s letter which he would\\r\\nnot read again but liked to think of, and Daisy\\'s photograph? And now\\r\\nfor dinner. They were eating. Sitting at little tables round vases, dressed or not dressed, with\\r\\ntheir shawls and bags laid beside them, with their air of false\\r\\ncomposure, for they were not used to so many courses at dinner, and\\r\\nconfidence, for they were able to pay for it, and strain, for they\\r\\nhad been running about London all day shopping, sightseeing; and\\r\\ntheir natural curiosity, for they looked round and up as the\\r\\nnice-looking gentleman in horn-rimmed spectacles came in, and their\\r\\ngood nature, for they would have been glad to do any little service,\\r\\nsuch as lend a time-table or impart useful information, and their\\r\\ndesire, pulsing in them, tugging at them subterraneously, somehow to\\r\\nestablish connections if it were only a birthplace (Liverpool, for\\r\\nexample) in common or friends of the same name; with their furtive\\r\\nglances, odd silences, and sudden withdrawals into family jocularity\\r\\nand isolation; there they sat eating dinner when Mr. Walsh came in\\r\\nand took his seat at a little table by the curtain. It was not that he said anything, for being solitary he could only\\r\\naddress himself to the waiter; it was his way of looking at the menu,\\r\\nof pointing his forefinger to a particular wine, of hitching himself\\r\\nup to the table, of addressing himself seriously, not gluttonously to\\r\\ndinner, that won him their respect; which, having to remain\\r\\nunexpressed for the greater part of the meal, flared up at the table\\r\\nwhere the Morrises sat when Mr. Walsh was heard to say at the end of\\r\\nthe meal, \"Bartlett pears.\" Why he should have spoken so moderately\\r\\nyet firmly, with the air of a disciplinarian well within his rights\\r\\nwhich are founded upon justice, neither young Charles Morris, nor old\\r\\nCharles, neither Miss Elaine nor Mrs. Morris knew. But when he said,\\r\\n\"Bartlett pears,\" sitting alone at his table, they felt that he\\r\\ncounted on their support in some lawful demand; was champion of a\\r\\ncause which immediately became their own, so that their eyes met his\\r\\neyes sympathetically, and when they all reached the smoking-room\\r\\nsimultaneously, a little talk between them became inevitable. It was not very profound--only to the effect that London was\\r\\ncrowded; had changed in thirty years; that Mr. Morris preferred\\r\\nLiverpool; that Mrs. Morris had been to the Westminster flower-show,\\r\\nand that they had all seen the Prince of Wales. Yet, thought Peter\\r\\nWalsh, no family in the world can compare with the Morrises; none\\r\\nwhatever; and their relations to each other are perfect, and they\\r\\ndon\\'t care a hang for the upper classes, and they like what they\\r\\nlike, and Elaine is training for the family business, and the boy has\\r\\nwon a scholarship at Leeds, and the old lady (who is about his own\\r\\nage) has three more children at home; and they have two motor cars,\\r\\nbut Mr. Morris still mends the boots on Sunday: it is superb, it is\\r\\nabsolutely superb, thought Peter Walsh, swaying a little backwards\\r\\nand forwards with his liqueur glass in his hand among the hairy red\\r\\nchairs and ash-trays, feeling very well pleased with himself, for the\\r\\nMorrises liked him. Yes, they liked a man who said, \"Bartlett pears.\"\\r\\nThey liked him, he felt. He would go to Clarissa\\'s party. (The Morrises moved off; but they\\r\\nwould meet again.) He would go to Clarissa\\'s party, because he wanted\\r\\nto ask Richard what they were doing in India--the conservative\\r\\nduffers. And what\\'s being acted? And music. . . . Oh yes, and mere\\r\\ngossip. For this is the truth about our soul, he thought, our self, who\\r\\nfish-like inhabits deep seas and plies among obscurities threading\\r\\nher way between the boles of giant weeds, over sun-flickered spaces\\r\\nand on and on into gloom, cold, deep, inscrutable; suddenly she\\r\\nshoots to the surface and sports on the wind-wrinkled waves; that is,\\r\\nhas a positive need to brush, scrape, kindle herself, gossiping. What\\r\\ndid the Government mean--Richard Dalloway would know--to do about\\r\\nIndia? Since it was a very hot night and the paper boys went by with\\r\\nplacards proclaiming in huge red letters that there was a heat-wave,\\r\\nwicker chairs were placed on the hotel steps and there, sipping,\\r\\nsmoking, detached gentlemen sat. Peter Walsh sat there. One might\\r\\nfancy that day, the London day, was just beginning. Like a woman who\\r\\nhad slipped off her print dress and white apron to array herself in\\r\\nblue and pearls, the day changed, put off stuff, took gauze, changed\\r\\nto evening, and with the same sigh of exhilaration that a woman\\r\\nbreathes, tumbling petticoats on the floor, it too shed dust, heat,\\r\\ncolour; the traffic thinned; motor cars, tinkling, darting, succeeded\\r\\nthe lumber of vans; and here and there among the thick foliage of the\\r\\nsquares an intense light hung. I resign, the evening seemed to say,\\r\\nas it paled and faded above the battlements and prominences, moulded,\\r\\npointed, of hotel, flat, and block of shops, I fade, she was\\r\\nbeginning, I disappear, but London would have none of it, and rushed\\r\\nher bayonets into the sky, pinioned her, constrained her to\\r\\npartnership in her revelry. For the great revolution of Mr. Willett\\'s summer time had taken\\r\\nplace since Peter Walsh\\'s last visit to England. The prolonged\\r\\nevening was new to him. It was inspiriting, rather. For as the young\\r\\npeople went by with their despatch-boxes, awfully glad to be free,\\r\\nproud too, dumbly, of stepping this famous pavement, joy of a kind,\\r\\ncheap, tinselly, if you like, but all the same rapture, flushed their\\r\\nfaces. They dressed well too; pink stockings; pretty shoes. They\\r\\nwould now have two hours at the pictures. It sharpened, it refined\\r\\nthem, the yellow-blue evening light; and on the leaves in the square\\r\\nshone lurid, livid--they looked as if dipped in sea water--the\\r\\nfoliage of a submerged city. He was astonished by the beauty; it was\\r\\nencouraging too, for where the returned Anglo-Indian sat by rights\\r\\n(he knew crowds of them) in the Oriental Club biliously summing up\\r\\nthe ruin of the world, here was he, as young as ever; envying young\\r\\npeople their summer time and the rest of it, and more than suspecting\\r\\nfrom the words of a girl, from a housemaid\\'s laughter--intangible\\r\\nthings you couldn\\'t lay your hands on--that shift in the whole\\r\\npyramidal accumulation which in his youth had seemed immovable. On\\r\\ntop of them it had pressed; weighed them down, the women especially,\\r\\nlike those flowers Clarissa\\'s Aunt Helena used to press between\\r\\nsheets of grey blotting-paper with Littré\\'s dictionary on top,\\r\\nsitting under the lamp after dinner. She was dead now. He had heard\\r\\nof her, from Clarissa, losing the sight of one eye. It seemed so\\r\\nfitting--one of nature\\'s masterpieces--that old Miss Parry should\\r\\nturn to glass. She would die like some bird in a frost gripping her\\r\\nperch. She belonged to a different age, but being so entire, so\\r\\ncomplete, would always stand up on the horizon, stone-white, eminent,\\r\\nlike a lighthouse marking some past stage on this adventurous, long,\\r\\nlong voyage, this interminable (he felt for a copper to buy a paper\\r\\nand read about Surrey and Yorkshire--he had held out that copper\\r\\nmillions of times. Surrey was all out once more)--this interminable\\r\\nlife. But cricket was no mere game. Cricket was important. He could\\r\\nnever help reading about cricket. He read the scores in the stop\\r\\npress first, then how it was a hot day; then about a murder case.\\r\\nHaving done things millions of times enriched them, though it might\\r\\nbe said to take the surface off. The past enriched, and experience,\\r\\nand having cared for one or two people, and so having acquired the\\r\\npower which the young lack, of cutting short, doing what one likes,\\r\\nnot caring a rap what people say and coming and going without any\\r\\nvery great expectations (he left his paper on the table and moved\\r\\noff), which however (and he looked for his hat and coat) was not\\r\\naltogether true of him, not to-night, for here he was starting to go\\r\\nto a party, at his age, with the belief upon him that he was about to\\r\\nhave an experience. But what? Beauty anyhow. Not the crude beauty of the eye. It was not beauty\\r\\npure and simple--Bedford Place leading into Russell Square. It was\\r\\nstraightness and emptiness of course; the symmetry of a corridor; but\\r\\nit was also windows lit up, a piano, a gramophone sounding; a sense\\r\\nof pleasure-making hidden, but now and again emerging when, through\\r\\nthe uncurtained window, the window left open, one saw parties sitting\\r\\nover tables, young people slowly circling, conversations between men\\r\\nand women, maids idly looking out (a strange comment theirs, when\\r\\nwork was done), stockings drying on top ledges, a parrot, a few\\r\\nplants. Absorbing, mysterious, of infinite richness, this life. And\\r\\nin the large square where the cabs shot and swerved so quick, there\\r\\nwere loitering couples, dallying, embracing, shrunk up under the\\r\\nshower of a tree; that was moving; so silent, so absorbed, that one\\r\\npassed, discreetly, timidly, as if in the presence of some sacred\\r\\nceremony to interrupt which would have been impious. That was\\r\\ninteresting. And so on into the flare and glare. His light overcoat blew open, he stepped with indescribable\\r\\nidiosyncrasy, lent a little forward, tripped, with his hands behind\\r\\nhis back and his eyes still a little hawklike; he tripped through\\r\\nLondon, towards Westminster, observing. Was everybody dining out, then? Doors were being opened here by a\\r\\nfootman to let issue a high-stepping old dame, in buckled shoes, with\\r\\nthree purple ostrich feathers in her hair. Doors were being opened\\r\\nfor ladies wrapped like mummies in shawls with bright flowers on\\r\\nthem, ladies with bare heads. And in respectable quarters with stucco\\r\\npillars through small front gardens lightly swathed with combs in\\r\\ntheir hair (having run up to see the children), women came; men\\r\\nwaited for them, with their coats blowing open, and the motor\\r\\nstarted. Everybody was going out. What with these doors being opened,\\r\\nand the descent and the start, it seemed as if the whole of London\\r\\nwere embarking in little boats moored to the bank, tossing on the\\r\\nwaters, as if the whole place were floating off in carnival. And\\r\\nWhitehall was skated over, silver beaten as it was, skated over by\\r\\nspiders, and there was a sense of midges round the arc lamps; it was\\r\\nso hot that people stood about talking. And here in Westminster was a\\r\\nretired Judge, presumably, sitting four square at his house door\\r\\ndressed all in white. An Anglo-Indian presumably. And here a shindy of brawling women, drunken women; here only a\\r\\npoliceman and looming houses, high houses, domed houses, churches,\\r\\nparliaments, and the hoot of a steamer on the river, a hollow misty\\r\\ncry. But it was her street, this, Clarissa\\'s; cabs were rushing round\\r\\nthe corner, like water round the piers of a bridge, drawn together,\\r\\nit seemed to him because they bore people going to her party,\\r\\nClarissa\\'s party. The cold stream of visual impressions failed him now as if the eye\\r\\nwere a cup that overflowed and let the rest run down its china walls\\r\\nunrecorded. The brain must wake now. The body must contract now,\\r\\nentering the house, the lighted house, where the door stood open,\\r\\nwhere the motor cars were standing, and bright women descending: the\\r\\nsoul must brave itself to endure. He opened the big blade of his\\r\\npocket-knife. \\xa0 \\xa0 Lucy came running full tilt downstairs, having just nipped in to\\r\\nthe drawing-room to smooth a cover, to straighten a chair, to pause a\\r\\nmoment and feel whoever came in must think how clean, how bright, how\\r\\nbeautifully cared for, when they saw the beautiful silver, the brass\\r\\nfire-irons, the new chair-covers, and the curtains of yellow chintz:\\r\\nshe appraised each; heard a roar of voices; people already coming up\\r\\nfrom dinner; she must fly! The Prime Minister was coming, Agnes said: so she had heard them\\r\\nsay in the dining-room, she said, coming in with a tray of glasses.\\r\\nDid it matter, did it matter in the least, one Prime Minister more or\\r\\nless? It made no difference at this hour of the night to Mrs. Walker\\r\\namong the plates, saucepans, cullenders, frying-pans, chicken in\\r\\naspic, ice-cream freezers, pared crusts of bread, lemons, soup\\r\\ntureens, and pudding basins which, however hard they washed up in the\\r\\nscullery seemed to be all on top of her, on the kitchen table, on\\r\\nchairs, while the fire blared and roared, the electric lights glared,\\r\\nand still supper had to be laid. All she felt was, one Prime Minister\\r\\nmore or less made not a scrap of difference to Mrs. Walker. The ladies were going upstairs already, said Lucy; the ladies were\\r\\ngoing up, one by one, Mrs. Dalloway walking last and almost always\\r\\nsending back some message to the kitchen, \"My love to Mrs. Walker,\"\\r\\nthat was it one night. Next morning they would go over the\\r\\ndishes--the soup, the salmon; the salmon, Mrs. Walker knew, as usual\\r\\nunderdone, for she always got nervous about the pudding and left it\\r\\nto Jenny; so it happened, the salmon was always underdone. But some\\r\\nlady with fair hair and silver ornaments had said, Lucy said, about\\r\\nthe entrée, was it really made at home? But it was the salmon\\r\\nthat bothered Mrs. Walker, as she spun the plates round and round,\\r\\nand pulled in dampers and pulled out dampers; and there came a burst\\r\\nof laughter from the dining-room; a voice speaking; then another\\r\\nburst of laughter--the gentlemen enjoying themselves when the ladies\\r\\nhad gone. The tokay, said Lucy running in. Mr. Dalloway had sent for\\r\\nthe tokay, from the Emperor\\'s cellars, the Imperial Tokay. It was borne through the kitchen. Over her shoulder Lucy reported\\r\\nhow Miss Elizabeth looked quite lovely; she couldn\\'t take her eyes\\r\\noff her; in her pink dress, wearing the necklace Mr. Dalloway had\\r\\ngiven her. Jenny must remember the dog, Miss Elizabeth\\'s fox-terrier,\\r\\nwhich, since it bit, had to be shut up and might, Elizabeth thought,\\r\\nwant something. Jenny must remember the dog. But Jenny was not going\\r\\nupstairs with all those people about. There was a motor at the door\\r\\nalready! There was a ring at the bell--and the gentlemen still in the\\r\\ndining-room, drinking tokay! There, they were going upstairs; that was the first to come, and\\r\\nnow they would come faster and faster, so that Mrs. Parkinson (hired\\r\\nfor parties) would leave the hall door ajar, and the hall would be\\r\\nfull of gentlemen waiting (they stood waiting, sleeking down their\\r\\nhair) while the ladies took their cloaks off in the room along the\\r\\npassage; where Mrs. Barnet helped them, old Ellen Barnet, who had\\r\\nbeen with the family for forty years, and came every summer to help\\r\\nthe ladies, and remembered mothers when they were girls, and though\\r\\nvery unassuming did shake hands; said \"milady\" very respectfully, yet\\r\\nhad a humorous way with her, looking at the young ladies, and ever so\\r\\ntactfully helping Lady Lovejoy, who had some trouble with her\\r\\nunderbodice. And they could not help feeling, Lady Lovejoy and Miss\\r\\nAlice, that some little privilege in the matter of brush and comb,\\r\\nwas awarded them having known Mrs. Barnet--\"thirty years, milady,\"\\r\\nMrs. Barnet supplied her. Young ladies did not use to rouge, said\\r\\nLady Lovejoy, when they stayed at Bourton in the old days. And Miss\\r\\nAlice didn\\'t need rouge, said Mrs. Barnet, looking at her fondly.\\r\\nThere Mrs. Barnet would sit, in the cloakroom, patting down the furs,\\r\\nsmoothing out the Spanish shawls, tidying the dressing-table, and\\r\\nknowing perfectly well, in spite of the furs and the embroideries,\\r\\nwhich were nice ladies, which were not. The dear old body, said Lady\\r\\nLovejoy, mounting the stairs, Clarissa\\'s old nurse. And then Lady Lovejoy stiffened. \"Lady and Miss Lovejoy,\" she said\\r\\nto Mr. Wilkins (hired for parties). He had an admirable manner, as he\\r\\nbent and straightened himself, bent and straightened himself and\\r\\nannounced with perfect impartiality \"Lady and Miss Lovejoy . . . Sir\\r\\nJohn and Lady Needham . . . Miss Weld . . . Mr. Walsh.\" His manner\\r\\nwas admirable; his family life must be irreproachable, except that it\\r\\nseemed impossible that a being with greenish lips and shaven cheeks\\r\\ncould ever have blundered into the nuisance of children. \"How delightful to see you!\" said Clarissa. She said it to every\\r\\none. How delightful to see you! She was at her worst--effusive,\\r\\ninsincere. It was a great mistake to have come. He should have stayed\\r\\nat home and read his book, thought Peter Walsh; should have gone to a\\r\\nmusic hall; he should have stayed at home, for he knew no one. Oh dear, it was going to be a failure; a complete failure,\\r\\nClarissa felt it in her bones as dear old Lord Lexham stood there\\r\\napologising for his wife who had caught cold at the Buckingham Palace\\r\\ngarden party. She could see Peter out of the tail of her eye,\\r\\ncriticising her, there, in that corner. Why, after all, did she do\\r\\nthese things? Why seek pinnacles and stand drenched in fire? Might it\\r\\nconsume her anyhow! Burn her to cinders! Better anything, better\\r\\nbrandish one\\'s torch and hurl it to earth than taper and dwindle away\\r\\nlike some Ellie Henderson! It was extraordinary how Peter put her\\r\\ninto these states just by coming and standing in a corner. He made\\r\\nher see herself; exaggerate. It was idiotic. But why did he come,\\r\\nthen, merely to criticise? Why always take, never give? Why not risk\\r\\none\\'s one little point of view? There he was wandering off, and she\\r\\nmust speak to him. But she would not get the chance. Life was\\r\\nthat--humiliation, renunciation. What Lord Lexham was saying was that\\r\\nhis wife would not wear her furs at the garden party because \"my\\r\\ndear, you ladies are all alike\"--Lady Lexham being seventy-five at\\r\\nleast! It was delicious, how they petted each other, that old couple.\\r\\nShe did like old Lord Lexham. She did think it mattered, her party,\\r\\nand it made her feel quite sick to know that it was all going wrong,\\r\\nall falling flat. Anything, any explosion, any horror was better than\\r\\npeople wandering aimlessly, standing in a bunch at a corner like\\r\\nEllie Henderson, not even caring to hold themselves upright. Gently the yellow curtain with all the birds of Paradise blew out\\r\\nand it seemed as if there were a flight of wings into the room, right\\r\\nout, then sucked back. (For the windows were open.) Was it draughty,\\r\\nEllie Henderson wondered? She was subject to chills. But it did not\\r\\nmatter that she should come down sneezing to-morrow; it was the girls\\r\\nwith their naked shoulders she thought of, being trained to think of\\r\\nothers by an old father, an invalid, late vicar of Bourton, but he\\r\\nwas dead now; and her chills never went to her chest, never. It was\\r\\nthe girls she thought of, the young girls with their bare shoulders,\\r\\nshe herself having always been a wisp of a creature, with her thin\\r\\nhair and meagre profile; though now, past fifty, there was beginning\\r\\nto shine through some mild beam, something purified into distinction\\r\\nby years of self-abnegation but obscured again, perpetually, by her\\r\\ndistressing gentility, her panic fear, which arose from three hundred\\r\\npounds\\' income, and her weaponless state (she could not earn a penny)\\r\\nand it made her timid, and more and more disqualified year by year to\\r\\nmeet well-dressed people who did this sort of thing every night of\\r\\nthe season, merely telling their maids \"I\\'ll wear so and so,\" whereas\\r\\nEllie Henderson ran out nervously and bought cheap pink flowers, half\\r\\na dozen, and then threw a shawl over her old black dress. For her\\r\\ninvitation to Clarissa\\'s party had come at the last moment. She was\\r\\nnot quite happy about it. She had a sort of feeling that Clarissa had\\r\\nnot meant to ask her this year. Why should she? There was no reason really, except that they had\\r\\nalways known each other. Indeed, they were cousins. But naturally\\r\\nthey had rather drifted apart, Clarissa being so sought after. It was\\r\\nan event to her, going to a party. It was quite a treat just to see\\r\\nthe lovely clothes. Wasn\\'t that Elizabeth, grown up, with her hair\\r\\ndone in the fashionable way, in the pink dress? Yet she could not be\\r\\nmore than seventeen. She was very, very handsome. But girls when they\\r\\nfirst came out didn\\'t seem to wear white as they used. (She must\\r\\nremember everything to tell Edith.) Girls wore straight frocks,\\r\\nperfectly tight, with skirts well above the ankles. It was not\\r\\nbecoming, she thought. So, with her weak eyesight, Ellie Henderson craned rather forward,\\r\\nand it wasn\\'t so much she who minded not having any one to talk to\\r\\n(she hardly knew anybody there), for she felt that they were all such\\r\\ninteresting people to watch; politicians presumably; Richard\\r\\nDalloway\\'s friends; but it was Richard himself who felt that he could\\r\\nnot let the poor creature go on standing there all the evening by\\r\\nherself. \"Well, Ellie, and how\\'s the world treating  ?\" he said in\\r\\nhis genial way, and Ellie Henderson, getting nervous and flushing and\\r\\nfeeling that it was extraordinarily nice of him to come and talk to\\r\\nher, said that many people really felt the heat more than the\\r\\ncold. \"Yes, they do,\" said Richard Dalloway. \"Yes.\" But what more did one say? \"Hullo, Richard,\" said somebody, taking him by the elbow, and,\\r\\ngood Lord, there was old Peter, old Peter Walsh. He was delighted to\\r\\nsee him--ever so pleased to see him! He hadn\\'t changed a bit. And off\\r\\nthey went together walking right across the room, giving each other\\r\\nlittle pats, as if they hadn\\'t met for a long time, Ellie Henderson\\r\\nthought, watching them go, certain she knew that man\\'s face. A tall\\r\\nman, middle aged, rather fine eyes, dark, wearing spectacles, with a\\r\\nlook of John Burrows. Edith would be sure to know. The curtain with its flight of birds of Paradise blew out again.\\r\\nAnd Clarissa saw--she saw Ralph Lyon beat it back, and go on talking.\\r\\nSo it wasn\\'t a failure after all! it was going to be all right\\r\\nnow--her party. It had begun. It had started. But it was still touch\\r\\nand go. She must stand there for the present. People seemed to come\\r\\nin a rush. Colonel and Mrs. Garrod . . . Mr. Hugh Whitbread . . . Mr. Bowley\\r\\n. . . Mrs. Hilbery . . . Lady Mary Maddox . . . Mr. Quin . . .\\r\\nintoned Wilkin. She had six or seven words with each, and they went\\r\\non, they went into the rooms; into something now, not nothing, since\\r\\nRalph Lyon had beat back the curtain. And yet for her own part, it was too much of an effort. She was\\r\\nnot enjoying it. It was too much like being--just anybody, standing\\r\\nthere; anybody could do it; yet this anybody she did a little admire,\\r\\ncouldn\\'t help feeling that she had, anyhow, made this happen, that it\\r\\nmarked a stage, this post that she felt herself to have become, for\\r\\noddly enough she had quite forgotten what she looked like, but felt\\r\\nherself a stake driven in at the top of her stairs. Every time she\\r\\ngave a party she had this feeling of being something not herself, and\\r\\nthat every one was unreal in one way; much more real in another. It\\r\\nwas, she thought, partly their clothes, partly being taken out of\\r\\ntheir ordinary ways, partly the background, it was possible to say\\r\\nthings you couldn\\'t say anyhow else, things that needed an effort;\\r\\npossible to go much deeper. But not for her; not yet anyhow. \"How delightful to see you!\" she said. Dear old Sir Harry! He\\r\\nwould know every one. And what was so odd about it was the sense one had as they came up\\r\\nthe stairs one after another, Mrs. Mount and Celia, Herbert Ainsty,\\r\\nMrs. Dakers--oh and Lady Bruton! \"How awfully good of you to come!\" she said, and she meant it--it\\r\\nwas odd how standing there one felt them going on, going on, some\\r\\nquite old, some . . .  name? Lady Rosseter? But who on earth was Lady\\r\\nRosseter? \"Clarissa!\" That voice! It was Sally Seton! Sally Seton! after all\\r\\nthese years! She loomed through a mist. For she hadn\\'t looked like\\r\\n  Sally Seton, when Clarissa grasped the hot water can, to\\r\\nthink of her under this roof, under this roof! Not like that! All on top of each other, embarrassed, laughing, words tumbled\\r\\nout--passing through London; heard from Clara Haydon; what a chance\\r\\nof seeing you! So I thrust myself in--without an invitation. . .\\r\\n. One might put down the hot water can quite composedly. The lustre\\r\\nhad gone out of her. Yet it was extraordinary to see her again,\\r\\nolder, happier, less lovely. They kissed each other, first this cheek\\r\\nthen that, by the drawing-room door, and Clarissa turned, with\\r\\nSally\\'s hand in hers, and saw her rooms full, heard the roar of\\r\\nvoices, saw the candlesticks, the blowing curtains, and the roses\\r\\nwhich Richard had given her. \"I have five enormous boys,\" said Sally. She had the simplest egotism, the most open desire to be thought\\r\\nfirst always, and Clarissa loved her for being still like that. \"I\\r\\ncan\\'t believe it!\" she cried, kindling all over with pleasure at the\\r\\nthought of the past. But alas, Wilkins; Wilkins wanted her; Wilkins was emitting in a\\r\\nvoice of commanding authority as if the whole company must be\\r\\nadmonished and the hostess reclaimed from frivolity, one name: \"The Prime Minister,\" said Peter Walsh. The Prime Minister? Was it really? Ellie Henderson marvelled. What\\r\\na thing to tell Edith! One couldn\\'t laugh at him. He looked so ordinary. You might have\\r\\nstood him behind a counter and bought biscuits--poor chap, all rigged\\r\\nup in gold lace. And to be fair, as he went his rounds, first with\\r\\nClarissa then with Richard escorting him, he did it very well. He\\r\\ntried to look somebody. It was amusing to watch. Nobody looked at\\r\\nhim. They just went on talking, yet it was perfectly plain that they\\r\\nall knew, felt to the marrow of their bones, this majesty passing;\\r\\nthis symbol of what they all stood for, English society. Old Lady\\r\\nBruton, and she looked very fine too, very stalwart in her lace, swam\\r\\nup, and they withdrew into a little room which at once became spied\\r\\nupon, guarded, and a sort of stir and rustle rippled through every\\r\\none, openly: the Prime Minister! Lord, lord, the snobbery of the English! thought Peter Walsh,\\r\\nstanding in the corner. How they loved dressing up in gold lace and\\r\\ndoing homage! There! That must be, by Jove it was, Hugh Whitbread,\\r\\nsnuffing round the precincts of the great, grown rather fatter,\\r\\nrather whiter, the admirable Hugh! He looked always as if he were on duty, thought Peter, a\\r\\nprivileged, but secretive being, hoarding secrets which he would die\\r\\nto defend, though it was only some little piece of tittle-tattle\\r\\ndropped by a court footman, which would be in all the papers\\r\\ntomorrow. Such were his rattles, his baubles, in playing with which\\r\\nhe had grown white, come to the verge of old age, enjoying the\\r\\nrespect and affection of all who had the privilege of knowing this\\r\\ntype of the English public school man. Inevitably one made up things\\r\\nlike that about Hugh; that was his style; the style of those\\r\\nadmirable letters which Peter had read thousands of miles across the\\r\\nsea in the   and had thanked God he was out of that\\r\\npernicious hubble-bubble if it were only to hear baboons chatter and\\r\\ncoolies beat their wives. An olive-skinned youth from one of the\\r\\nUniversities stood obsequiously by. Him he would patronise, initiate,\\r\\nteach how to get on. For he liked nothing better than doing\\r\\nkindnesses, making the hearts of old ladies palpitate with the joy of\\r\\nbeing thought of in their age, their affliction, thinking themselves\\r\\nquite forgotten, yet here was dear Hugh driving up and spending an\\r\\nhour talking of the past, remembering trifles, praising the home-made\\r\\ncake, though Hugh might eat cake with a Duchess any day of his life,\\r\\nand, to look at him, probably did spend a good deal of time in that\\r\\nagreeable occupation. The All-judging, the All-merciful, might\\r\\nexcuse. Peter Walsh had no mercy. Villains there must be, and God\\r\\nknows the rascals who get hanged for battering the brains of a girl\\r\\nout in a train do less harm on the whole than Hugh Whitbread and his\\r\\nkindness. Look at him now, on tiptoe, dancing forward, bowing and\\r\\nscraping, as the Prime Minister and Lady Bruton emerged, intimating\\r\\nfor all the world to see that he was privileged to say something,\\r\\nsomething private, to Lady Bruton as she passed. She stopped. She\\r\\nwagged her fine old head. She was thanking him presumably for some\\r\\npiece of servility. She had her toadies, minor officials in\\r\\nGovernment offices who ran about putting through little jobs on her\\r\\nbehalf, in return for which she gave them luncheon. But she derived\\r\\nfrom the eighteenth century. She was all right. And now Clarissa escorted her Prime Minister down the room,\\r\\nprancing, sparkling, with the stateliness of her grey hair. She wore\\r\\near-rings, and a silver-green mermaid\\'s dress. Lolloping on the waves\\r\\nand braiding her tresses she seemed, having that gift still; to be;\\r\\nto exist; to sum it all up in the moment as she passed; turned,\\r\\ncaught her scarf in some other woman\\'s dress, unhitched it, laughed,\\r\\nall with the most perfect ease and air of a creature floating in its\\r\\nelement. But age had brushed her; even as a mermaid might behold in\\r\\nher glass the setting sun on some very clear evening over the waves.\\r\\nThere was a breath of tenderness; her severity, her prudery, her\\r\\nwoodenness were all warmed through now, and she had about her as she\\r\\nsaid good-bye to the thick gold-laced man who was doing his best, and\\r\\ngood luck to him, to look important, an inexpressible dignity; an\\r\\nexquisite cordiality; as if she wished the whole world well, and must\\r\\nnow, being on the very verge and rim of things, take her leave. So\\r\\nshe made him think. (But he was not in love.) Indeed, Clarissa felt, the Prime Minister had been good to come.\\r\\nAnd, walking down the room with him, with Sally there and Peter there\\r\\nand Richard very pleased, with all those people rather inclined,\\r\\nperhaps, to envy, she had felt that intoxication of the moment, that\\r\\ndilatation of the nerves of the heart itself till it seemed to\\r\\nquiver, steeped, upright;--yes, but after all it was what other\\r\\npeople felt, that; for, though she loved it and felt it tingle and\\r\\nsting, still these semblances, these triumphs (dear old Peter, for\\r\\nexample, thinking her so brilliant), had a hollowness; at arm\\'s\\r\\nlength they were, not in the heart; and it might be that she was\\r\\ngrowing old but they satisfied her no longer as they used; and\\r\\nsuddenly, as she saw the Prime Minister go down the stairs, the gilt\\r\\nrim of the Sir Joshua picture of the little girl with a muff brought\\r\\nback Kilman with a rush; Kilman her enemy. That was satisfying; that\\r\\nwas real. Ah, how she hated her--hot, hypocritical, corrupt; with all\\r\\nthat power; Elizabeth\\'s seducer; the woman who had crept in to steal\\r\\nand defile (Richard would say, What nonsense!). She hated her: she\\r\\nloved her. It was enemies one wanted, not friends--not Mrs. Durrant\\r\\nand Clara, Sir William and Lady Bradshaw, Miss Truelock and Eleanor\\r\\nGibson (whom she saw coming upstairs). They must find her if they\\r\\nwanted her. She was for the party! There was her old friend Sir Harry. \"Dear Sir Harry!\" she said, going up to the fine old fellow who\\r\\nhad produced more bad pictures than any other two Academicians in the\\r\\nwhole of St. John\\'s Wood (they were always of cattle, standing in\\r\\nsunset pools absorbing moisture, or signifying, for he had a certain\\r\\nrange of gesture, by the raising of one foreleg and the toss of the\\r\\nantlers, \"the Approach of the Stranger\"--all his activities, dining\\r\\nout, racing, were founded on cattle standing absorbing moisture in\\r\\nsunset pools). \"What are you laughing at?\" she asked him. For Willie Titcomb and\\r\\nSir Harry and Herbert Ainsty were all laughing. But no. Sir Harry\\r\\ncould not tell Clarissa Dalloway (much though he liked her; of her\\r\\ntype he thought her perfect, and threatened to paint her) his stories\\r\\nof the music hall stage. He chaffed her about her party. He missed\\r\\nhis brandy. These circles, he said, were above him. But he liked her;\\r\\nrespected her, in spite of her damnable, difficult upper-class\\r\\nrefinement, which made it impossible to ask Clarissa Dalloway to sit\\r\\non his knee. And up came that wandering will-o\\'-the-wisp, that\\r\\nvagulous phosphorescence, old Mrs. Hilbery, stretching her hands to\\r\\nthe blaze of his laughter (about the Duke and the Lady), which, as\\r\\nshe heard it across the room, seemed to reassure her on a point which\\r\\nsometimes bothered her if she woke early in the morning and did not\\r\\nlike to call her maid for a cup of tea; how it is certain we must\\r\\ndie. \"They won\\'t tell us their stories,\" said Clarissa. \"Dear Clarissa!\" exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery. She looked to-night, she\\r\\nsaid, so like her mother as she first saw her walking in a garden in\\r\\na grey hat. And really Clarissa\\'s eyes filled with tears. Her mother, walking\\r\\nin a garden! But alas, she must go. For there was Professor Brierly, who lectured on Milton, talking\\r\\nto little Jim Hutton (who was unable even for a party like this to\\r\\ncompass both tie and waistcoat or make his hair lie flat), and even\\r\\nat this distance they were quarrelling, she could see. For Professor\\r\\nBrierly was a very queer fish. With all those degrees, honours,\\r\\nlectureships between him and the scribblers he suspected instantly an\\r\\natmosphere not favourable to his queer compound; his prodigious\\r\\nlearning and timidity; his wintry charm without cordiality; his\\r\\ninnocence blent with snobbery; he quivered if made conscious by a\\r\\nlady\\'s unkempt hair, a youth\\'s boots, of an underworld, very\\r\\ncreditable doubtless, of rebels, of ardent young people; of would-be\\r\\ngeniuses, and intimated with a little toss of the head, with a\\r\\nsniff--Humph!--the value of moderation; of some slight training in\\r\\nthe classics in order to appreciate Milton. Professor Brierly\\r\\n(Clarissa could see) wasn\\'t hitting it off with little Jim Hutton\\r\\n(who wore red socks, his black being at the laundry) about Milton.\\r\\nShe interrupted. She said she loved Bach. So did Hutton. That was the bond between\\r\\nthem, and Hutton (a very bad poet) always felt that Mrs. Dalloway was\\r\\nfar the best of the great ladies who took an interest in art. It was\\r\\nodd how strict she was. About music she was purely impersonal. She\\r\\nwas rather a prig. But how charming to look at! She made her house so\\r\\nnice if it weren\\'t for her Professors. Clarissa had half a mind to\\r\\nsnatch him off and set him down at the piano in the back room. For he\\r\\nplayed divinely. \"But the noise!\" she said. \"The noise!\" \"The sign of a successful party.\" Nodding urbanely, the Professor\\r\\nstepped delicately off. \"He knows everything in the whole world about Milton,\" said\\r\\nClarissa. \"Does he indeed?\" said Hutton, who would imitate the Professor\\r\\nthroughout Hampstead; the Professor on Milton; the Professor on\\r\\nmoderation; the Professor stepping delicately off. But she must speak to that couple, said Clarissa, Lord Gayton and\\r\\nNancy Blow. Not that   added perceptibly to the noise of the party.\\r\\nThey were not talking (perceptibly) as they stood side by side by the\\r\\nyellow curtains. They would soon be off elsewhere, together; and\\r\\nnever had very much to say in any circumstances. They looked; that\\r\\nwas all. That was enough. They looked so clean, so sound, she with an\\r\\napricot bloom of powder and paint, but he scrubbed, rinsed, with the\\r\\neyes of a bird, so that no ball could pass him or stroke surprise\\r\\nhim. He struck, he leapt, accurately, on the spot. Ponies\\' mouths\\r\\nquivered at the end of his reins. He had his honours, ancestral\\r\\nmonuments, banners hanging in the church at home. He had his duties;\\r\\nhis tenants; a mother and sisters; had been all day at Lords, and\\r\\nthat was what they were talking about--cricket, cousins, the\\r\\nmovies--when Mrs. Dalloway came up. Lord Gayton liked her most\\r\\nawfully. So did Miss Blow. She had such charming manners. \"It is angelic--it is delicious of you to have come!\" she said.\\r\\nShe loved Lords; she loved youth, and Nancy, dressed at enormous\\r\\nexpense by the greatest artists in Paris, stood there looking as if\\r\\nher body had merely put forth, of its own accord, a green frill. \"I had meant to have dancing,\" said Clarissa. For the young people could not talk. And why should they? Shout,\\r\\nembrace, swing, be up at dawn; carry sugar to ponies; kiss and caress\\r\\nthe snouts of adorable chows; and then all tingling and streaming,\\r\\nplunge and swim. But the enormous resources of the English language,\\r\\nthe power it bestows, after all, of communicating feelings (at their\\r\\nage, she and Peter would have been arguing all the evening), was not\\r\\nfor them. They would solidify young. They would be good beyond\\r\\nmeasure to the people on the estate, but alone, perhaps, rather\\r\\ndull. \"What a pity!\" she said. \"I had hoped to have dancing.\" It was so extraordinarily nice of them to have come! But talk of\\r\\ndancing! The rooms were packed. There was old Aunt Helena in her shawl. Alas, she must leave\\r\\nthem--Lord Gayton and Nancy Blow. There was old Miss Parry, her\\r\\naunt. For Miss Helena Parry was not dead: Miss Parry was alive. She was\\r\\npast eighty. She ascended staircases slowly with a stick. She was\\r\\nplaced in a chair (Richard had seen to it). People who had known\\r\\nBurma in the \\'seventies were always led up to her. Where had Peter\\r\\ngot to? They used to be such friends. For at the mention of India, or\\r\\neven Ceylon, her eyes (only one was glass) slowly deepened, became\\r\\nblue, beheld, not human beings--she had no tender memories, no proud\\r\\nillusions about Viceroys, Generals, Mutinies--it was orchids she saw,\\r\\nand mountain passes and herself carried on the backs of coolies in\\r\\nthe \\'sixties over solitary peaks; or descending to uproot orchids\\r\\n(startling blossoms, never beheld before) which she painted in\\r\\nwater-colour; an indomitable Englishwoman, fretful if disturbed by\\r\\nthe War, say, which dropped a bomb at her very door, from her deep\\r\\nmeditation over orchids and her own figure journeying in the \\'sixties\\r\\nin India--but here was Peter. \"Come and talk to Aunt Helena about Burma,\" said Clarissa. And yet he had not had a word with her all the evening! \"We will talk later,\" said Clarissa, leading him up to Aunt\\r\\nHelena, in her white shawl, with her stick. \"Peter Walsh,\" said Clarissa. That meant nothing. Clarissa had asked her. It was tiring; it was noisy; but Clarissa\\r\\nhad asked her. So she had come. It was a pity that they lived in\\r\\nLondon--Richard and Clarissa. If only for Clarissa\\'s health it would\\r\\nhave been better to live in the country. But Clarissa had always been\\r\\nfond of society. \"He has been in Burma,\" said Clarissa. Ah. She could not resist recalling what Charles Darwin had said\\r\\nabout her little book on the orchids of Burma. (Clarissa must speak to Lady Bruton.) No doubt it was forgotten now, her book on the orchids of Burma,\\r\\nbut it went into three editions before 1870, she told Peter. She\\r\\nremembered him now. He had been at Bourton (and he had left her,\\r\\nPeter Walsh remembered, without a word in the drawing-room that night\\r\\nwhen Clarissa had asked him to come boating). \"Richard so much enjoyed his lunch party,\" said Clarissa to Lady\\r\\nBruton. \"Richard was the greatest possible help,\" Lady Bruton replied. \"He\\r\\nhelped me to write a letter. And how are you?\" \"Oh, perfectly well!\" said Clarissa. (Lady Bruton detested illness\\r\\nin the wives of politicians.) \"And there\\'s Peter Walsh!\" said Lady Bruton (for she could never\\r\\nthink of anything to say to Clarissa; though she liked her. She had\\r\\nlots of fine qualities; but they had nothing in common--she and\\r\\nClarissa. It might have been better if Richard had married a woman\\r\\nwith less charm, who would have helped him more in his work. He had\\r\\nlost his chance of the Cabinet). \"There\\'s Peter Walsh!\" she said,\\r\\nshaking hands with that agreeable sinner, that very able fellow who\\r\\nshould have made a name for himself but hadn\\'t (always in\\r\\ndifficulties with women), and, of course, old Miss Parry. Wonderful\\r\\nold lady! Lady Bruton stood by Miss Parry\\'s chair, a spectral grenadier,\\r\\ndraped in black, inviting Peter Walsh to lunch; cordial; but without\\r\\nsmall talk, remembering nothing whatever about the flora or fauna of\\r\\nIndia. She had been there, of course; had stayed with three Viceroys;\\r\\nthought some of the Indian civilians uncommonly fine fellows; but\\r\\nwhat a tragedy it was--the state of India! The Prime Minister had\\r\\njust been telling her (old Miss Parry huddled up in her shawl, did\\r\\nnot care what the Prime Minister had just been telling her), and Lady\\r\\nBruton would like to have Peter Walsh\\'s opinion, he being fresh from\\r\\nthe centre, and she would get Sir Sampson to meet him, for really it\\r\\nprevented her from sleeping at night, the folly of it, the wickedness\\r\\nshe might say, being a soldier\\'s daughter. She was an old woman now,\\r\\nnot good for much. But her house, her servants, her good friend Milly\\r\\nBrush--did he remember her?--were all there only asking to be used\\r\\nif--if they could be of help, in short. For she never spoke of\\r\\nEngland, but this isle of men, this dear, dear land, was in her blood\\r\\n(without reading Shakespeare), and if ever a woman could have worn\\r\\nthe helmet and shot the arrow, could have led troops to attack, ruled\\r\\nwith indomitable justice barbarian hordes and lain under a shield\\r\\nnoseless in a church, or made a green grass mound on some primeval\\r\\nhillside, that woman was Millicent Bruton. Debarred by her sex and\\r\\nsome truancy, too, of the logical faculty (she found it impossible to\\r\\nwrite a letter to the  ), she had the thought of Empire\\r\\nalways at hand, and had acquired from her association with that\\r\\narmoured goddess her ramrod bearing, her robustness of demeanour, so\\r\\nthat one could not figure her even in death parted from the earth or\\r\\nroaming territories over which, in some spiritual shape, the Union\\r\\nJack had ceased to fly. To be not English even among the dead--no,\\r\\nno! Impossible! But was it Lady Bruton (whom she used to know)? Was it Peter Walsh\\r\\ngrown grey? Lady Rosseter asked herself (who had been Sally Seton).\\r\\nIt was old Miss Parry certainly--the old aunt who used to be so cross\\r\\nwhen she stayed at Bourton. Never should she forget running along the\\r\\npassage naked, and being sent for by Miss Parry! And Clarissa! oh\\r\\nClarissa! Sally caught her by the arm. Clarissa stopped beside them. \"But I can\\'t stay,\" she said. \"I shall come later. Wait,\" she\\r\\nsaid, looking at Peter and Sally. They must wait, she meant, until\\r\\nall these people had gone. \"I shall come back,\" she said, looking at her old friends, Sally\\r\\nand Peter, who were shaking hands, and Sally, remembering the past no\\r\\ndoubt, was laughing. But her voice was wrung of its old ravishing richness; her eyes\\r\\nnot aglow as they used to be, when she smoked cigars, when she ran\\r\\ndown the passage to fetch her sponge bag, without a stitch of\\r\\nclothing on her, and Ellen Atkins asked, What if the gentlemen had\\r\\nmet her? But everybody forgave her. She stole a chicken from the\\r\\nlarder because she was hungry in the night; she smoked cigars in her\\r\\nbedroom; she left a priceless book in the punt. But everybody adored\\r\\nher (except perhaps Papa). It was her warmth; her vitality--she would\\r\\npaint, she would write. Old women in the village never to this day\\r\\nforgot to ask after \"your friend in the red cloak who seemed so\\r\\nbright.\" She accused Hugh Whitbread, of all people (and there he was,\\r\\nher old friend Hugh, talking to the Portuguese Ambassador), of\\r\\nkissing her in the smoking-room to punish her for saying that women\\r\\nshould have votes. Vulgar men did, she said. And Clarissa remembered\\r\\nhaving to persuade her not to denounce him at family prayers--which\\r\\nshe was capable of doing with her daring, her recklessness, her\\r\\nmelodramatic love of being the centre of everything and creating\\r\\nscenes, and it was bound, Clarissa used to think, to end in some\\r\\nawful tragedy; her death; her martyrdom; instead of which she had\\r\\nmarried, quite unexpectedly, a bald man with a large buttonhole who\\r\\nowned, it was said, cotton mills at Manchester. And she had five\\r\\nboys! She and Peter had settled down together. They were talking: it\\r\\nseemed so familiar--that they should be talking. They would discuss\\r\\nthe past. With the two of them (more even than with Richard) she\\r\\nshared her past; the garden; the trees; old Joseph Breitkopf singing\\r\\nBrahms without any voice; the drawing-room wallpaper; the smell of\\r\\nthe mats. A part of this Sally must always be; Peter must always be.\\r\\nBut she must leave them. There were the Bradshaws, whom she disliked.\\r\\nShe must go up to Lady Bradshaw (in grey and silver, balancing like a\\r\\nsea-lion at the edge of its tank, barking for invitations, Duchesses,\\r\\nthe typical successful man\\'s wife), she must go up to Lady Bradshaw\\r\\nand say . . . But Lady Bradshaw anticipated her. \"We are shockingly late, dear Mrs. Dalloway, we hardly dared to\\r\\ncome in,\" she said. And Sir William, who looked very distinguished, with his grey hair\\r\\nand blue eyes, said yes; they had not been able to resist the\\r\\ntemptation. He was talking to Richard about that Bill probably, which\\r\\nthey wanted to get through the Commons. Why did the sight of him,\\r\\ntalking to Richard, curl her up? He looked what he was, a great\\r\\ndoctor. A man absolutely at the head of his profession, very\\r\\npowerful, rather worn. For think what cases came before him--people\\r\\nin the uttermost depths of misery; people on the verge of insanity;\\r\\nhusbands and wives. He had to decide questions of appalling\\r\\ndifficulty. Yet--what she felt was, one wouldn\\'t like Sir William to\\r\\nsee one unhappy. No; not that man. \"How is your son at Eton?\" she asked Lady Bradshaw. He had just missed his eleven, said Lady Bradshaw, because of the\\r\\nmumps. His father minded even more than he did, she thought \"being,\"\\r\\nshe said, \"nothing but a great boy himself.\" Clarissa looked at Sir William, talking to Richard. He did not\\r\\nlook like a boy--not in the least like a boy. She had once gone with\\r\\nsome one to ask his advice. He had been perfectly right; extremely\\r\\nsensible. But Heavens--what a relief to get out to the street again!\\r\\nThere was some poor wretch sobbing, she remembered, in the\\r\\nwaiting-room. But she did not know what it was--about Sir William;\\r\\nwhat exactly she disliked. Only Richard agreed with her, \"didn\\'t like\\r\\nhis taste, didn\\'t like his smell.\" But he was extraordinarily able.\\r\\nThey were talking about this Bill. Some case, Sir William was\\r\\nmentioning, lowering his voice. It had its bearing upon what he was\\r\\nsaying about the deferred effects of shell shock. There must be some\\r\\nprovision in the Bill. Sinking her voice, drawing Mrs. Dalloway into the shelter of a\\r\\ncommon femininity, a common pride in the illustrious qualities of\\r\\nhusbands and their sad tendency to overwork, Lady Bradshaw (poor\\r\\ngoose--one didn\\'t dislike her) murmured how, \"just as we were\\r\\nstarting, my husband was called up on the telephone, a very sad case.\\r\\nA young man (that is what Sir William is telling Mr. Dalloway) had\\r\\nkilled himself. He had been in the army.\" Oh! thought Clarissa, in\\r\\nthe middle of my party, here\\'s death, she thought. She went on, into the little room where the Prime Minister had\\r\\ngone with Lady Bruton. Perhaps there was somebody there. But there\\r\\nwas nobody. The chairs still kept the impress of the Prime Minister\\r\\nand Lady Bruton, she turned deferentially, he sitting four-square,\\r\\nauthoritatively. They had been talking about India. There was nobody.\\r\\nThe party\\'s splendour fell to the floor, so strange it was to come in\\r\\nalone in her finery. What business had the Bradshaws to talk of death at her party? A\\r\\nyoung man had killed himself. And they talked of it at her party--the\\r\\nBradshaws, talked of death. He had killed himself--but how? Always\\r\\nher body went through it first, when she was told, suddenly, of an\\r\\naccident; her dress flamed, her body burnt. He had thrown himself\\r\\nfrom a window. Up had flashed the ground; through him, blundering,\\r\\nbruising, went the rusty spikes. There he lay with a thud, thud, thud\\r\\nin his brain, and then a suffocation of blackness. So she saw it. But\\r\\nwhy had he done it? And the Bradshaws talked of it at her party! She had once thrown a shilling into the Serpentine, never anything\\r\\nmore. But he had flung it away. They went on living (she would have\\r\\nto go back; the rooms were still crowded; people kept on coming).\\r\\nThey (all day she had been thinking of Bourton, of Peter, of Sally),\\r\\nthey would grow old. A thing there was that mattered; a thing,\\r\\nwreathed about with chatter, defaced, obscured in her own life, let\\r\\ndrop every day in corruption, lies, chatter. This he had preserved.\\r\\nDeath was defiance. Death was an attempt to communicate; people\\r\\nfeeling the impossibility of reaching the centre which, mystically,\\r\\nevaded them; closeness drew apart; rapture faded, one was alone.\\r\\nThere was an embrace in death. But this young man who had killed himself--had he plunged holding\\r\\nhis treasure? \"If it were now to die, \\'twere now to be most happy,\"\\r\\nshe had said to herself once, coming down in white. Or there were the poets and thinkers. Suppose he had had that\\r\\npassion, and had gone to Sir William Bradshaw, a great doctor yet to\\r\\nher obscurely evil, without sex or lust, extremely polite to women,\\r\\nbut capable of some indescribable outrage--forcing your soul, that\\r\\nwas it--if this young man had gone to him, and Sir William had\\r\\nimpressed him, like that, with his power, might he not then have said\\r\\n(indeed she felt it now), Life is made intolerable; they make life\\r\\nintolerable, men like that? Then (she had felt it only this morning) there was the terror; the\\r\\noverwhelming incapacity, one\\'s parents giving it into one\\'s hands,\\r\\nthis life, to be lived to the end, to be walked with serenely; there\\r\\nwas in the depths of her heart an awful fear. Even now, quite often\\r\\nif Richard had not been there reading the   so that she\\r\\ncould crouch like a bird and gradually revive, send roaring up that\\r\\nimmeasurable delight, rubbing stick to stick, one thing with another,\\r\\nshe must have perished. But that young man had killed himself. Somehow it was her disaster--her disgrace. It was her punishment\\r\\nto see sink and disappear here a man, there a woman, in this profound\\r\\ndarkness, and she forced to stand here in her evening dress. She had\\r\\nschemed; she had pilfered. She was never wholly admirable. She had\\r\\nwanted success. Lady Bexborough and the rest of it. And once she had\\r\\nwalked on the terrace at Bourton. It was due to Richard; she had never been so happy. Nothing could\\r\\nbe slow enough; nothing last too long. No pleasure could equal, she\\r\\nthought, straightening the chairs, pushing in one book on the shelf,\\r\\nthis having done with the triumphs of youth, lost herself in the\\r\\nprocess of living, to find it, with a shock of delight, as the sun\\r\\nrose, as the day sank. Many a time had she gone, at Bourton when they\\r\\nwere all talking, to look at the sky; or seen it between people\\'s\\r\\nshoulders at dinner; seen it in London when she could not sleep. She\\r\\nwalked to the window. It held, foolish as the idea was, something of her own in it, this\\r\\ncountry sky, this sky above Westminster. She parted the curtains; she\\r\\nlooked. Oh, but how surprising!--in the room opposite the old lady\\r\\nstared straight at her! She was going to bed. And the sky. It will be\\r\\na solemn sky, she had thought, it will be a dusky sky, turning away\\r\\nits cheek in beauty. But there it was--ashen pale, raced over quickly\\r\\nby tapering vast clouds. It was new to her. The wind must have risen.\\r\\nShe was going to bed, in the room opposite. It was fascinating to\\r\\nwatch her, moving about, that old lady, crossing the room, coming to\\r\\nthe window. Could she see her? It was fascinating, with people still\\r\\nlaughing and shouting in the drawing-room, to watch that old woman,\\r\\nquite quietly, going to bed. She pulled the blind now. The clock\\r\\nbegan striking. The young man had killed himself; but she did not\\r\\npity him; with the clock striking the hour, one, two, three, she did\\r\\nnot pity him, with all this going on. There! the old lady had put out\\r\\nher light! the whole house was dark now with this going on, she\\r\\nrepeated, and the words came to her, Fear no more the heat of the\\r\\nsun. She must go back to them. But what an extraordinary night! She\\r\\nfelt somehow very like him--the young man who had killed himself. She\\r\\nfelt glad that he had done it; thrown it away. The clock was\\r\\nstriking. The leaden circles dissolved in the air. He made her feel\\r\\nthe beauty; made her feel the fun. But she must go back. She must\\r\\nassemble. She must find Sally and Peter. And she came in from the\\r\\nlittle room. \"But where is Clarissa?\" said Peter. He was sitting on the sofa\\r\\nwith Sally. (After all these years he really could not call her \"Lady\\r\\nRosseter.\") \"Where\\'s the woman gone to?\" he asked. \"Where\\'s\\r\\nClarissa?\" Sally supposed, and so did Peter for the matter of that, that\\r\\nthere were people of importance, politicians, whom neither of them\\r\\nknew unless by sight in the picture papers, whom Clarissa had to be\\r\\nnice to, had to talk to. She was with them. Yet there was Richard\\r\\nDalloway not in the Cabinet. He hadn\\'t been a success, Sally\\r\\nsupposed? For herself, she scarcely ever read the papers. She\\r\\nsometimes saw his name mentioned. But then--well, she lived a very\\r\\nsolitary life, in the wilds, Clarissa would say, among great\\r\\nmerchants, great manufacturers, men, after all, who did things. She\\r\\nhad done things too! \"I have five sons!\" she told him. Lord, Lord, what a change had come over her! the softness of\\r\\nmotherhood; its egotism too. Last time they met, Peter remembered,\\r\\nhad been among the cauliflowers in the moonlight, the leaves \"like\\r\\nrough bronze\" she had said, with her literary turn; and she had\\r\\npicked a rose. She had marched him up and down that awful night,\\r\\nafter the scene by the fountain; he was to catch the midnight train.\\r\\nHeavens, he had wept! That was his old trick, opening a pocket-knife, thought Sally,\\r\\nalways opening and shutting a knife when he got excited. They had\\r\\nbeen very, very intimate, she and Peter Walsh, when he was in love\\r\\nwith Clarissa, and there was that dreadful, ridiculous scene over\\r\\nRichard Dalloway at lunch. She had called Richard \"Wickham.\" Why not\\r\\ncall Richard \"Wickham\"? Clarissa had flared up! and indeed they had\\r\\nnever seen each other since, she and Clarissa, not more than half a\\r\\ndozen times perhaps in the last ten years. And Peter Walsh had gone\\r\\noff to India, and she had heard vaguely that he had made an unhappy\\r\\nmarriage, and she didn\\'t know whether he had any children, and she\\r\\ncouldn\\'t ask him, for he had changed. He was rather\\r\\nshrivelled-looking, but kinder, she felt, and she had a real\\r\\naffection for him, for he was connected with her youth, and she still\\r\\nhad a little Emily Brontë he had given her, and he was to write,\\r\\nsurely? In those days he was to write. \"Have you written?\" she asked him, spreading her hand, her firm\\r\\nand shapely hand, on her knee in a way he recalled. \"Not a word!\" said Peter Walsh, and she laughed. She was still attractive, still a personage, Sally Seton. But who\\r\\nwas this Rosseter? He wore two camellias on his wedding day--that was\\r\\nall Peter knew of him. \"They have myriads of servants, miles of\\r\\nconservatories,\" Clarissa wrote; something like that. Sally owned it\\r\\nwith a shout of laughter. \"Yes, I have ten thousand a year\"--whether before the tax was paid\\r\\nor after, she couldn\\'t remember, for her husband, \"whom you must\\r\\nmeet,\" she said, \"whom you would like,\" she said, did all that for\\r\\nher. And Sally used to be in rags and tatters. She had pawned her\\r\\ngrandmother\\'s ring which Marie Antoinette had given her\\r\\ngreat-grandfather to come to Bourton. Oh yes, Sally remembered; she had it still, a ruby ring which\\r\\nMarie Antoinette had given her great-grandfather. She never had a\\r\\npenny to her name in those days, and going to Bourton always meant\\r\\nsome frightful pinch. But going to Bourton had meant so much to\\r\\nher--had kept her sane, she believed, so unhappy had she been at\\r\\nhome. But that was all a thing of the past--all over now, she said.\\r\\nAnd Mr. Parry was dead; and Miss Parry was still alive. Never had he\\r\\nhad such a shock in his life! said Peter. He had been quite certain\\r\\nshe was dead. And the marriage had been, Sally supposed, a success?\\r\\nAnd that very handsome, very self-possessed young woman was\\r\\nElizabeth, over there, by the curtains, in red. (She was like a poplar, she was like a river, she was like a\\r\\nhyacinth, Willie Titcomb was thinking. Oh how much nicer to be in the\\r\\ncountry and do what she liked! She could hear her poor dog howling,\\r\\nElizabeth was certain.) She was not a bit like Clarissa, Peter Walsh\\r\\nsaid. \"Oh, Clarissa!\" said Sally. What Sally felt was simply this. She had owed Clarissa an enormous\\r\\namount. They had been friends, not acquaintances, friends, and she\\r\\nstill saw Clarissa all in white going about the house with her hands\\r\\nfull of flowers--to this day tobacco plants made her think of\\r\\nBourton. But--did Peter understand?--she lacked something. Lacked\\r\\nwhat was it? She had charm; she had extraordinary charm. But to be\\r\\nfrank (and she felt that Peter was an old friend, a real friend--did\\r\\nabsence matter? did distance matter? She had often wanted to write to\\r\\nhim, but torn it up, yet felt he understood, for people understand\\r\\nwithout things being said, as one realises growing old, and old she\\r\\nwas, had been that afternoon to see her sons at Eton, where they had\\r\\nthe mumps), to be quite frank then, how could Clarissa have done\\r\\nit?--married Richard Dalloway? a sportsman, a man who cared only for\\r\\ndogs. Literally, when he came into the room he smelt of the stables.\\r\\nAnd then all this? She waved her hand. Hugh Whitbread it was, strolling past in his white waistcoat, dim,\\r\\nfat, blind, past everything he looked, except self-esteem and\\r\\ncomfort. \"He\\'s not going to recognise  ,\" said Sally, and really\\r\\nshe hadn\\'t the courage--so that was Hugh! the admirable Hugh! \"And what does he do?\" she asked Peter. He blacked the King\\'s boots or counted bottles at Windsor, Peter\\r\\ntold her. Peter kept his sharp tongue still! But Sally must be frank,\\r\\nPeter said. That kiss now, Hugh\\'s. On the lips, she assured him, in the smoking-room one evening. She\\r\\nwent straight to Clarissa in a rage. Hugh didn\\'t do such things!\\r\\nClarissa said, the admirable Hugh! Hugh\\'s socks were without\\r\\nexception the most beautiful she had ever seen--and now his evening\\r\\ndress. Perfect! And had he children? \"Everybody in the room has six sons at Eton,\" Peter told her,\\r\\nexcept himself. He, thank God, had none. No sons, no daughters, no\\r\\nwife. Well, he didn\\'t seem to mind, said Sally. He looked younger,\\r\\nshe thought, than any of them. But it had been a silly thing to do, in many ways, Peter said, to\\r\\nmarry like that; \"a perfect goose she was,\" he said, but, he said,\\r\\n\"we had a splendid time of it,\" but how could that be? Sally\\r\\nwondered; what did he mean? and how odd it was to know him and yet\\r\\nnot know a single thing that had happened to him. And did he say it\\r\\nout of pride? Very likely, for after all it must be galling for him\\r\\n(though he was an oddity, a sort of sprite, not at all an ordinary\\r\\nman), it must be lonely at his age to have no home, nowhere to go to.\\r\\nBut he must stay with them for weeks and weeks. Of course he would;\\r\\nhe would love to stay with them, and that was how it came out. All\\r\\nthese years the Dalloways had never been once. Time after time they\\r\\nhad asked them. Clarissa (for it was Clarissa of course) would not\\r\\ncome. For, said Sally, Clarissa was at heart a snob--one had to admit\\r\\nit, a snob. And it was that that was between them, she was convinced.\\r\\nClarissa thought she had married beneath her, her husband being--she\\r\\nwas proud of it--a miner\\'s son. Every penny they had he had earned.\\r\\nAs a little boy (her voice trembled) he had carried great sacks. (And so she would go on, Peter felt, hour after hour; the miner\\'s\\r\\nson; people thought she had married beneath her; her five sons; and\\r\\nwhat was the other thing--plants, hydrangeas, syringas, very, very\\r\\nrare hibiscus lilies that never grow north of the Suez Canal, but\\r\\nshe, with one gardener in a suburb near Manchester, had beds of them,\\r\\npositively beds! Now all that Clarissa had escaped, unmaternal as she\\r\\nwas.) A snob was she? Yes, in many ways. Where was she, all this time?\\r\\nIt was getting late. \"Yet,\" said Sally, \"when I heard Clarissa was giving a party, I\\r\\nfelt I couldn\\'t   come--must see her again (and I\\'m staying\\r\\nin Victoria Street, practically next door). So I just came without an\\r\\ninvitation. But,\" she whispered, \"tell me, do. Who is this?\" It was Mrs. Hilbery, looking for the door. For how late it was\\r\\ngetting! And, she murmured, as the night grew later, as people went,\\r\\none found old friends; quiet nooks and corners; and the loveliest\\r\\nviews. Did they know, she asked, that they were surrounded by an\\r\\nenchanted garden? Lights and trees and wonderful gleaming lakes and\\r\\nthe sky. Just a few fairy lamps, Clarissa Dalloway had said, in the\\r\\nback garden! But she was a magician! It was a park. . . . And she\\r\\ndidn\\'t know their names, but friends she knew they were, friends\\r\\nwithout names, songs without words, always the best. But there were\\r\\nso many doors, such unexpected places, she could not find her\\r\\nway. \"Old Mrs. Hilbery,\" said Peter; but who was that? that lady\\r\\nstanding by the curtain all the evening, without speaking? He knew\\r\\nher face; connected her with Bourton. Surely she used to cut up\\r\\nunderclothes at the large table in the window? Davidson, was that her\\r\\nname? \"Oh, that is Ellie Henderson,\" said Sally. Clarissa was really\\r\\nvery hard on her. She was a cousin, very poor. Clarissa  \\r\\nhard on people. She was rather, said Peter. Yet, said Sally, in her emotional way,\\r\\nwith a rush of that enthusiasm which Peter used to love her for, yet\\r\\ndreaded a little now, so effusive she might become--how generous to\\r\\nher friends Clarissa was! and what a rare quality one found it, and\\r\\nhow sometimes at night or on Christmas Day, when she counted up her\\r\\nblessings, she put that friendship first. They were young; that was\\r\\nit. Clarissa was pure-hearted; that was it. Peter would think her\\r\\nsentimental. So she was. For she had come to feel that it was the\\r\\nonly thing worth saying--what one felt. Cleverness was silly. One\\r\\nmust say simply what one felt. \"But I do not know,\" said Peter Walsh, \"what I feel.\" Poor Peter, thought Sally. Why did not Clarissa come and talk to\\r\\nthem? That was what he was longing for. She knew it. All the time he\\r\\nwas thinking only of Clarissa, and was fidgeting with his knife. He had not found life simple, Peter said. His relations with\\r\\nClarissa had not been simple. It had spoilt his life, he said. (They\\r\\nhad been so intimate--he and Sally Seton, it was absurd not to say\\r\\nit.) One could not be in love twice, he said. And what could she say?\\r\\nStill, it is better to have loved (but he would think her\\r\\nsentimental--he used to be so sharp). He must come and stay with them\\r\\nin Manchester. That is all very true, he said. All very true. He\\r\\nwould love to come and stay with them, directly he had done what he\\r\\nhad to do in London. And Clarissa had cared for him more than she had ever cared for\\r\\nRichard. Sally was positive of that. \"No, no, no!\" said Peter (Sally should not have said that--she\\r\\nwent too far). That good fellow--there he was at the end of the room,\\r\\nholding forth, the same as ever, dear old Richard. Who was he talking\\r\\nto? Sally asked, that very distinguished-looking man? Living in the\\r\\nwilds as she did, she had an insatiable curiosity to know who people\\r\\nwere. But Peter did not know. He did not like his looks, he said,\\r\\nprobably a Cabinet Minister. Of them all, Richard seemed to him the\\r\\nbest, he said--the most disinterested. \"But what has he done?\" Sally asked. Public work, she supposed.\\r\\nAnd were they happy together? Sally asked (she herself was extremely\\r\\nhappy); for, she admitted, she knew nothing about them, only jumped\\r\\nto conclusions, as one does, for what can one know even of the people\\r\\none lives with every day? she asked. Are we not all prisoners? She\\r\\nhad read a wonderful play about a man who scratched on the wall of\\r\\nhis cell, and she had felt that was true of life--one scratched on\\r\\nthe wall. Despairing of human relationships (people were so\\r\\ndifficult), she often went into her garden and got from her flowers a\\r\\npeace which men and women never gave her. But no; he did not like\\r\\ncabbages; he preferred human beings, Peter said. Indeed, the young\\r\\nare beautiful, Sally said, watching Elizabeth cross the room. How\\r\\nunlike Clarissa at her age! Could he make anything of her? She would\\r\\nnot open her lips. Not much, not yet, Peter admitted. She was like a\\r\\nlily, Sally said, a lily by the side of a pool. But Peter did not\\r\\nagree that we know nothing. We know everything, he said; at least he\\r\\ndid. But these two, Sally whispered, these two coming now (and really\\r\\nshe must go, if Clarissa did not come soon), this\\r\\ndistinguished-looking man and his rather common-looking wife who had\\r\\nbeen talking to Richard--what could one know about people like\\r\\nthat? \"That they\\'re damnable humbugs,\" said Peter, looking at them\\r\\ncasually. He made Sally laugh. But Sir William Bradshaw stopped at the door to look at a picture.\\r\\nHe looked in the corner for the engraver\\'s name. His wife looked too.\\r\\nSir William Bradshaw was so interested in art. When one was young, said Peter, one was too much excited to know\\r\\npeople. Now that one was old, fifty-two to be precise (Sally was\\r\\nfifty-five, in body, she said, but her heart was like a girl\\'s of\\r\\ntwenty); now that one was mature then, said Peter, one could watch,\\r\\none could understand, and one did not lose the power of feeling, he\\r\\nsaid. No, that is true, said Sally. She felt more deeply, more\\r\\npassionately, every year. It increased, he said, alas, perhaps, but\\r\\none should be glad of it--it went on increasing in his experience.\\r\\nThere was some one in India. He would like to tell Sally about her.\\r\\nHe would like Sally to know her. She was married, he said. She had\\r\\ntwo small children. They must all come to Manchester, said Sally--he\\r\\nmust promise before they left. There\\'s Elizabeth, he said, she feels not half what we feel, not\\r\\nyet. But, said Sally, watching Elizabeth go to her father, one can\\r\\nsee they are devoted to each other. She could feel it by the way\\r\\nElizabeth went to her father. For her father had been looking at her, as he stood talking to the\\r\\nBradshaws, and he had thought to himself, Who is that lovely girl?\\r\\nAnd suddenly he realised that it was his Elizabeth, and he had not\\r\\nrecognised her, she looked so lovely in her pink frock! Elizabeth had\\r\\nfelt him looking at her as she talked to Willie Titcomb. So she went\\r\\nto him and they stood together, now that the party was almost over,\\r\\nlooking at the people going, and the rooms getting emptier and\\r\\nemptier, with things scattered on the floor. Even Ellie Henderson was\\r\\ngoing, nearly last of all, though no one had spoken to her, but she\\r\\nhad wanted to see everything, to tell Edith. And Richard and\\r\\nElizabeth were rather glad it was over, but Richard was proud of his\\r\\ndaughter. And he had not meant to tell her, but he could not help\\r\\ntelling her. He had looked at her, he said, and he had wondered, Who\\r\\nis that lovely girl? and it was his daughter! That did make her\\r\\nhappy. But her poor dog was howling. \"Richard has improved. You are right,\" said Sally. \"I shall go and\\r\\ntalk to him. I shall say goodnight. What does the brain matter,\" said\\r\\nLady Rosseter, getting up, \"compared with the heart?\" \"I will come,\" said Peter, but he sat on for a moment. What is\\r\\nthis terror? what is this ecstasy? he thought to himself. What is it\\r\\nthat fills me with extraordinary excitement? It is Clarissa, he said. For there she was. \\xa0 \\xa0   '"

    "A handful of texts, particularly the short stories and essays, proved more challenging to extract since they shared a web page with multiple other texts. For example, Street Haunting was problematic because of its position halfway down the page, which means we have to find a way to jump halfway down the page and start extracting text from there. I deal with them on a case by case basis here, using the .split() function to manually find the location from which I would like to begin extracting."

    "## Making Use of Sentences: Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentiment Analysis Overview:**<br>\n",
    "Now that we have dataframes of the sentences that compose each text, the next challenge is finding ways to correctly quantify the text's very qualitative characteristics. With sentiment analysis, we can try to perceive a very subjective concept through objective terms like numbers. Unlike humans, computers struggle with understanding the double meanings, innuendos, negations, or the evoked (but not articulated) emotions in text. Thus, while it may seem easy at first, sentiment analysis is a tricky task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Vader Method:**<br>\n",
    "A method for sentiment analysis is Vader (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner). According to the authors, it is \"a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool.\" Vader is a model used for text sentiment analysis sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. Available in the NLTK package, Vader can be applied directly to unlabeled text data. Based on the work of 10 coders, the Vader dictionary includes approximately 7,500 words, emoticons, emojis, acronyms, and commonly used slang.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Vader sentiment analysis relies on a dictionary that maps lexical feature to emotion intensities, known as sentiment scores, or \"vader scores\", as we will call them in this study. The sentiment (\"vader\") score of a text can be obtained by summing up each word's intensity in the text. Vader returns the proportion of a text that is negative, positive, and neutral, along with vader_compound, the normalized, weighted composite score. The polarity scores express a positive, negative, or neutral opinion. \n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of using Vader is that Vader scores an entire text, not just words. Looking at the whole text allows the algorithm to adjust for negations, such as \"not,\" booster words, such as \"remarkably.\" It also scores words written in all caps as more intense. It looks at words in context and scores them appropriately, while other methods might only look at singular words but ignore things like negations or amplifiers that surround that individual word."

    "This data might be better visualized as a line plot, especially if we would like to see how the calculated vader scores increase or decrease as we move further into Woolf's career. We can find the average compound, positive, and negative vader scores for each of Woolf's texts. Then, we can see how these scores change across time and works by ordering the texts in chronological order."

    "As we saw before, Modern Fiction and Street Haunting have the highest vader_compound scores, meaning they are overall the most 'positive.' However, vader_compound scores are a balance of the neutral, positive, and negative vader scores. Looking at purely the vader_positive and vader_negative scores might be useful at looking at the magnitude of purely the positive and negative emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph above plots vader_negative's intensity, so the most 'negative' text is where the vader_neg score is the highest, which would be Flush. Kew Gardens also has the lowest vader_neg score, which means it has a low negative emotion value. On the other hand, Modern Fiction and Mrs. Dalloway have the two highest positive vader scores, which means that those texts were the most positive on average, according to the Vader method. As we can see, Modern Fiction and Street Haunting had the highest calculated positivity out of the works we analyzed. However, it might be more useful to look at Woolf's works' sentiments within their individual genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we can observe the computed fluctuations in each text's magnitude of positive and negative emotion in chronological order. It seems that Modern Fiction had the highest intensity of positive emotion, while Flush had the highest value for negative emotion. From looking at how the intensities as time passes, we can see both emotions remain relatively constant, aside from a slight decline in positive vader scores for the texts towards the latter half of Woolf's career."

    "### Chronological Emotion Across All Novels\n",
    "Analyzing changing sentiment across all genres is useful in depicting how emotion shifts throughout Woolf's career. However, it could be interesting to focus specifically on her novels. Woolf's lyrical technique is incredibly distinctive in her irreplaceable ability to evoke and convey emotion within and between characters. Some of her most notable novels are explicitly known for their sentimentality. Graphing their sentiment, and comparing the quantitative perception of emotion for each text, may provide new insight into her most significant works."

    "The graph above shows a decline in overall positivity as Woolf's literary career progresses, specifically with the publication of novels. The Voyage Out, published in 1915, was Woolf's first novel. Night and Day, 1919, was considered by Woolf to be her \"traditional\" novel, in the manner of the nineteenth-century novelists she admired. Jacob's Room, 1922, was her first truly experimental novel based on her elder brother, Thoby Stephen, who died of a fever in 1906. The somber source of inspiration for Jacob's Room might explain the dip in positive sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, we see a surge in positive sentiment in Mrs. Dalloway, 1925. We see that, overall, Mrs. Dalloway has a lower vader_compound score than Night and Day. However, it also has more extreme emotion, as shown by its higher intensity vader_pos and vader_neg scores.  The amplitude of emotion provides a new way of interpreting the text, in combination with our knowledge of its main characters' polarity -- particularly, the schizophrenic Septimus Smith.\n",
    "\n",
    "After Mrs. Dalloway, Woolf's texts drop in positive sentiment, according to the Vader method. If this is true, then drawing on the context of these texts might provide meaning. The publication of Mrs. Dalloway and To the Lighthouse are the peaks of Woolf's career; they help her garner international acclaim and recognition. These two works indeed are her most famous works.\n",
    "\n",
    "To the Lighthouse is then followed by The Waves, a novel generally considered to be Woolf's masterpiece, while also her most experimental and challenging work. Although this novel is perhaps her most distinguished, it remains to this day her most enigmatic. Consisting of nine chapters, each describes a stage in six characters' lives from childhood to old age. Considered her most solemn piece,  the visualization above certainly supports the preconceived perception of The Wave's melancholy. Indeed, The Waves has the lowest vader_compound score, as well as the highest vader_neg score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Published in 1937, The Years traces the life of a Victorian family from 1880 to \"Present Day.\" This novel started as a sequel to A Room of One's Own, with the initial intention to alternate nonfiction essays the family's story. However, Woolf ultimately extracted the nonfiction sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Woolf's last novel, published posthumously in 1941, takes place in a short period in June of 1939, focused on a play hosted in a local town. Woolf had yet to correct the typescript of the novel at the time of her death, and thus many critics consider Between the Acts to be an unfinished novel. In this novel, the reader can sense the lingering ramifications of World War 1 and the anxious anticipation of World War 2. With Woolf's worsening mental health as a background for the creation of Between The Acts, one can understand why we see a decline in vader_compound scores for this novel. Woolf's last work, Between the Acts, illustrates Woolf's mounting concern at the threat of war, with her degrading happiness."

It might be interesting to see, especially with novels such as Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, and Between the Acts, where time plays an integral role in the text's progression and how emotion fluctuates within. Below, oscillations in vader_compound, vader_pos, and vader_neg help visualize any trends in the ebb and flow of emotion across each text.\n",
    "\n",
    "As each novel is of different lengths, we had to use the same reference points for time. To do this, we divided each novel into fifteen segments and found the average vader scores for each sentence within the fifteen segments. Thus, we can plot the fifteen segments' emotion values and compare them across different time points in each text. "

    "**Novel Analysis:**<br>\n",
    "This visualization presents a shared pattern across the three texts, with the emotional fluctuations of To The Lighthouse and Between the Acts being the most similar. A few common themes and characteristics across these three texts are intriguing to revisit in the context of this visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, Mrs. Dalloway takes place entirely in one day, in the life of Clarissa Dalloway and her double, Septimus Smith, the shell-shocked WW1 veteran. The entire novel spans only one day in July, and is centered around the social event that night, the party Mrs. Dalloway is hosting. At this party, she hears of the suicide of Septimus Smith, which could be shown by the sudden drop in the vader score towards the end of the story's narrative. We also see that Mrs. Dalloway has a significant amount of extreme highs and lows in vader_score. In Mrs. Dalloway, a considerable amount of the discourse is dictated by the polarizing, sporadic, and extreme emotions and anxieties of the schizophrenic Septimus Smith. Perhaps, these spikes are a signal of precisely that; they show the extraordinary intensity of which the characters feel; the depression, mania, trauma, and fervor throughout their narratives, particularly Septimus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Mrs. Dalloway, To The Lighthouse experiences extreme highs and extreme lows, as shown by the vader_compound score reaching almost as high as 0.15 and subsequently dropping to almost -0.025. To The Lighthouse is divided into three segments, with the first being the longest. While it is hard to tell where these three segments might lay on the plot above, we can see three prominent 'highs' at 1, 7, and 15, and two 'lows' at 5 and 10. In Part 1: The Window, the section begins with the Ramsay's discussion of visiting the Lighthouse, and moves on to the characters Lily Briscoe, Charles Tansley, and Augustus Carmichael, among a few others. This section closes with a large dinner party, ending with Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay interacting, alone, at the end of the night. In the next section, Part 2: Time Passes, ten years pass, during which the First World War starts and ends. We find out that Mrs. Ramsay, and two of her children, also die, one killed in the war.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final section, Part 3: The Lighthouse, the Ramsays, and some of their past guests, return to their summer home after ten years and finally make the trip to the Lighthouse. This section might be seen on the graph from point 10-15, with the gradual increasing positivity of the vader scores. We see the mood improve from Section 2, which focused predominantly on the abandonment of the summer home, the implications of WW1, and the Ramsay family members' loneliness. However, in section 3, we finally see the characters experience harmony between each other: Mr. Ramsay praises James on their sail over to the Lighthouse, Cam slowly trades her resentment towards her father for compassion and respect, and Lily finally finishes her painting to a point in which she is satisfied; the Lighthouse is reached, the family's tension has fizzled, and Lily discovered the true meaning behind her work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, in this visualization, we see that Between the Acts is computed to be the saddest novel of the three, with vader_compound scores consistently lower than the other two. The novel's sentiment fluctuates, albeit to a much smaller degree than the other two texts, and stays between the 0.00-0.05 range. Between the Acts itself flits between not just various characters, but various time periods, as Miss La Trobe's play portrays centuries of famous literature and theatre. After multiple pathways and trajectories, the novel ends in a moment of suspension, dispersion, and anticipation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As reflected in the visualization above, we see multiple smaller fluctuations, rather than sweeping shifts between sentiment like in the other two novels. Towards the end of the novel, we see a plateau -- the curtain's opening, the question left unanswered, the anticlimactic dispersion of the audience escaping the literary world and returning to their material one. Woolf, shortly after writing the typescript of Between the Acts, decided to end her own life, due to the onset of another terrible period of mental illness, paired with the anticipation of an oncoming invasion by Hitler. The novel itself dissipates into an open ending; questions are left unanswered, and the book unfinished."

    "## Short Stories:\n",
    "Another primary genre in which Woolf contributed beautiful works of literature was short stories; her two most notable ones being Mark on the Wall, her first publication, and Kew Gardens. We will look at these two short stories, alongside a short story that came a dozen years later: Street Haunting: A London Adventure, 1930."

    "**Short Stories Analysis:**<br>\n",
    "Initially, one can notice the separation between The Mark on the Wall and Kew Gardens, with Street Haunting. Perhaps this is a sign of the times; as we saw with her novels, Woolf's work experienced a decline in overall positive sentiment as time went on. The Mark on the Wall and Kew Gardens are also much more similar in lyrical style. Published within two years of each other, The Mark on the Wall and Kew Gardens are often juxtaposed together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mark on the Wall was published by subscription in a venture called \"Two Stories,\" in July 1917 as the Hogarth Press's first publication. The Mark on the Wall is invaluable in the ways Woolf can fill the piece with incredibly evocative, engaging, and articulate emotions and thoughts, all stimulated by an obscure mark on the wall, a snail. This story is one of the first in literary history to attach such significance to how each human individually perceives, interprets, and reacts to the world around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In \"Kew Gardens\" (1919), Woolf takes the snail from \"The Mark on the Wall\" and uses it as her principal narrative angle for \"Kew Gardens.\" The conversations, thoughts, and emotions of passersby are perceived and conveyed from the snail on the flower bed. This narrative form was an entirely new way of storytelling, as time and space are fragmented, speech and thought are fractured. From the insipient literary experimentation in \"The Mark on the Wall\" and \"Kew Gardens,\" Woolf created full-length masterpieces of literary innovation, such as Jacob's Room, and later perfect this technique in Mrs. Dalloway and To the Lighthouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Street Haunting, published in a collection of short stories called \"Monday and Tuesday\" in 1927, describes an expedition on London's winter streets at night. Unlike \"The Mark on the Wall\" and \"Kew Gardens,\" the narrative perspective is transitory; it explores alleyways, dives into bookstores, interacts with passersby, imagines itself in others' homes. However, the formerly discussed short stories draft storylines from the perspective of a narrator who stays stationary. Perhaps this influences each short story; the static nature of the narrator in the first two texts allows the insertion of multiple more perspectives, hence the oscillating emotion per the various transitions between characters. Meanwhile, in \"Street Haunting,\" the narrator must physically move in order to 'emotionally' move from perspective to perspective, a tedious process, which as a result, happens less frequently, but more dramatically."

    "Flush and Orlando are depicted to be quite the opposite of each other throughout each respective text, with respect to the vader compound scores. According to the graph above, when Orlando is around its peak positivity, at that same point in the text (relative to each text's length, in this case, two tenths into the book), Flush is at its peak negativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Orlando: A Biography (1928) fuses biography with fantasy, evading gender and time restrictions. It depicts the poet Orlando, who lives from the Elizabethan times to the day of the biography's publication while turning from a man to a woman halfway into the novel. Besides an entertaining escape from her heavier pieces, Orlando also serves as a love-letter to her close friend and lover, Vita Sackville-West. This \"biography,\" filled with audacity and irreverence, was an immediate sensation. Meanwhile, Flush: A Biography (1933) was a comic novel written from the point of view of Elizabeth Barret Browning's cocker spaniel, Flush. Despite being relatively light-hearted, Flush has vader_compound scores that fall into the negative for most of the narrative. After completing her emotionally draining novel, Woolf wrote this biography, The Waves, so perhaps lingering melancholy from the creation of The Waves manifest itself in Flush.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike with other visualizations, the differences across texts in this genre are harder to justify, given our literary understanding. It might be useful to look at exactly what sentences are the saddest and happiest in these respective biographies. Flush is not typically categorized as one of Woolf's most depressing or melancholy texts, so we can try looking at the most 'emotional' sentence in the text to help us find the answer."

    "While the uncovering of these sentences might not be the most ground-breaking, it is interesting to see how the Vader method can identify each text's negative and positive sentences and the words within each sentence that lead to this classification. In Flush, the saddest sentence is grounded in the dog's physical state: his thirst and his disgust for the water in front of him. This could explain why Flush has such a low vader_compound score; rather than being weighted down by negative words discussing heavier subjects surrounding death, depression, or trauma, the text is littered with negative words about more trivial matters. Thus, the Vader method picks up many negative words, making Flush Woolf's most 'negative' text according to vader_compoudn scores. However, as readers, we do not perceive Flush as a necessarily sad text since we discern the negativity about trivial matters from significant ones."

    "Woolf was also extremely well-known for her writings promoting liberal politics, particularly the feminist and anti-fascist movements. Her two most notable political pieces are A Room of One's Own and Three Guineas. This study also analyzes Woolf's two essays that pose compelling arguments and opinions in the context of literature, Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown, and Modern Fiction."

    "**Essay Analysis:**<br>\n",
    "\"Modern Fiction\" is perhaps the best known of all Virginia Woolf's essays. Woolf's argument in this essay is built on the materialistic preoccupation so novelists who see only the body and nothing of the mind. She argues that the future novels must leave the external world, focus more closely on the interior of human experiences, look inside the mind on an ordinary day, and turn these objects into the novel's subject. This principle is upheld throughout her texts, particularly Jacob's Room, Mrs. Dalloway, and To the Lighthouse. In the same vein, Woolf's essay Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown are also critical essays that discuss literary creation. Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown serves as a literary manifesto that repudiates the earlier generations' novels, as they invented trivia to fill their pages, thus depriving readers of insight into human character. Prior novelists would have refused to look deeply at life and the intricacy of human character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, Woolf's essays A Room of One's Own and Three Guineas take a stance on a broader, more controversial stage. A Room of One's Own, published in 1929, stands as the classic essay on feminism, characterized by its shrewd reasoning. In this essay, Woolf argues for equal rights for both sexes, proves how women are deprived of powers and privileges, and imagines instances that illustrate how women have been kept mute, maternal, poor, and oppressed. Three Guineas, 1938, serve as a sequel to A Room of One's Own while also branching off to dive into the realm of war and fascism. In the growing threat of another world war, Woolf critiques patriarchy and fascism, highlighting women's oppression in society and the male norms of violence, competition, and domination.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can understand why A Room of One's Own and Three Guineas might have very similar vader scores. However, this visualization showcases a surprising spike in vader_pos and vader_compound for Modern Fiction, a spike that fails to be reflected in the similar essay Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown. Again, it might be useful to see where this dissimilarity is coming from through these texts'  extraordinarily positive and negative sentences. For example, how do the 'saddest' sentences in each of Woolf's critical essays compare -- do they all speak of the same topics, critiquing the same societal downfalls and disappointments? "

However, while looking at the highs and lows of these critiques, it would be interesting to look at the most negative sentences in Woolf's two political polemics, A Room of One's Own and Three Guineas."

    "There seems to a common thread between these two sentences in the deliberate mention of \"killing\" and \"war\" in each respective sentence. In A Room of One's Own, the most negative sentence discusses the male nature of domination or control, how society normalizes violence by men, and engrains in them an insatiable desire to oppress. Then, in Three Guineas, this sentence uses the phrase \"prosecution in the war\" three times, discussing the role of an individual in the war's prosecution. When thinking back to the text, I am sure many other sentences might be more violent. However, it might be the repeated use of that phrase that consistently amplifies the negativity of war; although, in context, one might view the war's prosecution as a positive."

    "Emotion, particularly in Woolfean literature, is an incredibly elusive and evasive characteristic to quantify. However, through text-mining, semantic analysis, and data visualizations, we can try to find ways to accurately capture objective illustrations of this very subjective nature that underlays each of Woolf's texts. These dataframes, summary statistics, and visualizations provide new lenses through which we could re-explore and re-imagine Woolf's texts. While our quantitative analyses might not have always given us the answers to our qualitative ambiguities, they provoked intriguing new questions to ask, uncovered unseen similarities across texts, and unmasked an uncharted side to understanding the worlds Woolf created."

    "Thank you to Professor Elizabeth Evans for providing me with the space and time to take on this challenging expedition! This project would not have been possible without your encouragement, guidance, and all I have learned about Woolf this past semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would also like to acknowledge Project Gutenberg for publishing free online versions of Virginia Woolf's texts. Without their efforts to digitize, archive, and distribute our society's greatest literary accomplishments, this research would not have been possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I would like to recognize the informative references I have used throughout this project, as listed below. They were critical in helping me fully understand the Vader method, as well as the few Woolfean texts I was unfamiliar with before this project."
